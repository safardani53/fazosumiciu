He died in his home in Atlanta. Ted was only 68. The team's current head coach, Matt LaFleur stated, "We are sitting here with heavy hearts today. I just know how important he was to many people in this building."&nbsp;</p><p>So what was his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cause of death</a>?</p><p>Ted was known for drafting some of the biggest names in Packers history, like Aaron Rodgers, David Bakhtiari, Mason Crosby, Davante Adams, and others. In fact, he built the 2010-11 Super Bowl winning team. Even the way players are drafted now is reminiscent of Ted's methodology. According to The Spun, "<a href=# rel=nofollow>Ted Thompson‚Äôs influence</a> clearly remains with current GM Brian Gutenkunst and the rest of the front office."</p><p>‚ÄúHis impact is still felt to this day when you look at our roster," Matt said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Ted Thompson's cause of death?</h2><p>It has not been announced what former Green Bay Packers GM Ted Thompson's cause of death is. However, it was reported in May 2019 that Ted was diagnosed with an autonomic disorder that affected his nerves. His declining health was what forced him to step down as GM after the 2017 season. It's unclear how or why he developed the disorder, since it can sometimes be the result of another health issue, like Parkinson's or diabetes.</p><p>In an official statement, Ted announced, ‚ÄúI have been diagnosed with an autonomic disorder. I feel that it‚Äôs important to mention that based on the test results and opinions of medical specialists, they feel that I do not fit the profile of someone suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).‚Äù CTE is a progressive and fatal condition that has no cure or treatment. It's unclear whether Ted actually had CTE (and medical professionals can only determine this after someone dies).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ted Thompson, the former <a href=#>#Packers</a> general manager who drafted a Hall of Fame quarterback, built the Super Bowl XLV championship team, & shepherded one of the most successful stretches in team history, has passed away at age 68: <a href=#>https://t.co/COgiSZgo02</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gHKgEo5spN</a></p>‚Äî Green Bay Packers (@packers) <a href=#>January 21, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>According to Packers News, people began noticing <a href=# rel=nofollow>a difference in Ted's behavior in 2017</a>.
