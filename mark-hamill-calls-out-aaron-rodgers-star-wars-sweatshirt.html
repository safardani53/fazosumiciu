Hamill, who is famous for playing Luke Skywalker, retweeted a clip of Rodgers' appearance and joked, "Of all the sweatshirts he could have worn, he had to take full responsibility in THAT one?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hamill most recently reprised his iconic Skywalker role in Rise of Skywalker, the latest installment in the hit franchise.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Allen Berezovsky/FilmMagic; Ethan Miller/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rodgers' Tuesday appearance comes after the NFL star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>confirmed</a> he was not vaccinated against COVID-19 and had tested positive for the virus. He had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>told</a> reporters in August that he had been "immunized."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>previous interview</a> with the Pat McAfee Show last Friday, Rodgers said he did not get vaccinated because he was allergic to an ingredient in the mRNA vaccines and did not want to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine because he "heard of multiple people who had had adverse events" after receiving the shot.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>The Pat McAfee Show</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of getting vaccinated, Rodgers told McAfee he took ivermectin — a deworming drug most commonly administered to animals — as part of an alternative "immunization protocol." Use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 in humans or animals has not been approved by the FDA.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When speaking on the show Tuesday, Rodgers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>defended</a> himself as "an athlete, not an activist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I understand that people are suffering and this has been a really difficult time for the last two years on so many people. I think we all know individuals who have lost their lives personally, people who've lost their businesses, their livelihoods, their way of life has been altered completely," he said. "I empathize with those things and I also know how sports can be such a connector and bring people together in times of adversity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rodgers added, "I do realize that I am a role model to a lot of people and so I just want to start off the show by acknowledging that I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading. To anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm excited about feeling better," he continued. "I'm excited about moving forward and hopefully getting back on my team and getting back to do what I do best — and that's playing ball. It's been tough to be away from it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As information about the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> coronavirus pandemic</a> rapidly changes, PEOPLE is committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.
