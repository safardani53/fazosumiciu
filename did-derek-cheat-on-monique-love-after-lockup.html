However, in many cases, many of them learn that life on the outside is just as chaotic. This is especially true for Monique and Derek, who took center stage on the WE tv series after they joined the show in Season 4."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Monique addressed her man’s critics, noting that viewers only see “the man Derek was when he first got out of prison,” versus who he is today.</p><p>“They were just saying like, I'm still with this man that cheated on me and made all these mistakes," Monique told us. “This was literally the first couple of weeks he got out of prison.

But according to Monique, moving forward meant “a lot of forgiveness” on her part. “It took a lot of growth on both ends for us to fully understand each other and get to the place that we're at right now,” the Love After Lockup star shared.</p><p>Derek said he doesn’t blame Monique for her trust issues and takes “full responsibility” for the hurt he caused her in the past. “I knew what I where I went wrong,” Derek admitted. “Now that I'm doing better and treating her better and being faithful, we don't have to worry about that no more.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@_livetruelife_</a><p>Derek and Monique from 'Love After Lockup'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When did Derek cheat on Monique?
