“I just really wanted the music to be fun, even our first dance,” the Duchess of Sussex, 41, said in a Saturday, December 10, clip from the second half of their Harry & Meghan docuseries. “[Was it] ‘Song of 1000 Dances?’ I always get it wrong."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was so fun,” the&nbsp;<i>Bench&nbsp;</i>author remembered in <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>Harry & Meghan&nbsp;</i>scene</a>. “Just spinning like a whirlwind. It was so great.”</p><p class=p1>The Duke of Sussex and Meghan<a href=#> began dating in July 2016</a>, getting engaged nearly one year later. The pair wed in May 2018 at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, followed by an intimate reception at Frogmore House. The married couple — who share <a href=#>son Archie, 3, and daughter Lilibet, 18 months</a> — even <a href=#>shared the invitations during the first part of&nbsp;<i>Harry & Meghan</i></a>, which premiered on Thursday, December 8.</p><p class=p1>“Please join us for dinner and dancing<a href=#> to celebrate our wedding</a>,” the note read, per a photo <a href=#>shared in the Netflix docuseries</a>, revealing the stationary was decorated with a border of white flowers. The twosome also signed the card, “Love Haz & Meg,” using<a href=#> their informal nicknames for one another</a>.</p><p class=p1><i>Harry & Meghan</i>, directed by <strong>Liz Garbus</strong>, chronicles the duo’s childhoods, familial relationships growing up and <a href=#>their early courtship</a> leading up to<a href=#> their November 2017 engagement announcement</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-recall-whirlwind-1st-dance-in-sneak-peek-of-2nd-part-of-netflix-doc-01.jpg><p class=p1>“It was, you know, rehearsed. We did the thing out with the press, then we went right inside, took the coat off and did the interview,” Meghan r<a href=#>emembered in the second episode</a> of the pair’s first joint interview after getting engaged. “So it’s all in that same moment.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Suits&nbsp;</i>alum further likened the experience to an “orchestrated reality show,” in which she was heavily prepared about what she could speak about. “[They said], ‘There’ll be a moment they want to see the ring, so show the ring,’” she said, claiming they were not “allowed” to tell the real story.</p><p class=p1>Harry and Meghan further opened up about their experience — and <a href=#>sharing several never-before-seen private family pics</a> — as the duchess learned <a href=#>what it meant to become a senior working royal</a>. (The Archewell cofounders stepped down in 2020 and have since relocated to California.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Joining this family, I <a href=#>knew that there was a protocol for how things were done</a>,” Meghan said during the third episode. “Do you remember that old movie&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Princess Diaries</i></a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong></a>? There’s no class [where] some person goes, ‘Sit like this, cross your legs like this, use this fork, don’t do this, curtsy then, wear this kind of hat.’ It doesn’t happen. So, <a href=#>I needed to learn a lot</a>, including the national anthem. … It was baptism by fire.”</p><p class=p1>The first three episodes of&nbsp;<i>Harry & Meghan</i>&nbsp;are now streaming on Netflix. The final three episodes premiere on Thursday, December 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKeroZ6Ysm60wKupsmWdmrSprc1mpJqqm6GybrvNZq6enJSeu6h50qiloGWUpLC2v8SroJ6rXamyor%2FEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
