The 43-year-old actor had vowed to officiate the wedding if the fan, Twitter user @ErickaElizabeth, got enough retweets. She did, and he followed through — and even showed up to the ceremony dressed like his character, Sheriff Jim Hopper.
“Hey internet,” Harbour tweeted on Saturday, September 15. “I know it’s been awhile."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m loving the material that I have. I think everyone’s gonna like it a lot.”</p><p>Matarazzo also revealed season 3 is “scarier” than past chapters and “very, very original.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He elaborated: “I feel like the past two seasons thrived a lot on nostalgia and reference. I don’t think this season needs it as much anymore. We get it, it’s in the ‘80s. The show is great by itself, and I think they want to show that they have abilities to capture audiences without going back to stuff that’s already been used … Season 3 is gonna come and it’s gonna be more, ‘Whoa! That’s unexpected.’”</p><p>With reporting by Kayley Stumpe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuarpmZeqmt0ZumrqpdpLOntcKimK2do2LAtb7Ap56eql2ptaq6xqxkn5meqHq4scOdoKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
