An industry source, Matt Belloni, has disclosed Cumberbatch’s remuneration for his second Doctor Strange picture, which is a whopping $7.5 million upfront. Add in the box office bonuses, and Benedict Cumberbatch is making a tidy sum from the film.&nbsp;Given the MCU’s track record, it is very guaranteed that the second Doctor Strange film will gross a sizable sum, and Cumberbatch will earn handsomely. This is a huge rise for Cumberbatch, who allegedly earned roughly $6 million for his efforts on Doctor Strange in 2016, Thor: Ragnarok in 2017, and the previous two Avengers films.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Benedict-Cumberbatch-2.jpg alt="Benedict Cumberbatch" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While the money is not as high as what Robert Downey Jr. received for his efforts in Marvel films, it is still motivating, particularly considering Doctor Strange’s rising importance in the MCU.
