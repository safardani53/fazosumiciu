However, Bucky’s character in the comics hasn’t come out as gay or bisexual yet.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Lead Writer of the Show Addressed the Fan Theory</h2><p>The showrunner for the action show, Malcolm Spellman, recently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a>&nbsp;to a question about Bucky’s sexual orientation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While talking to NME on March 26, 2021, the lead writer, Spellman, suggestively said, “I’m not diving down rabbit holes, but keep watching.” <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>That statement was made in reply to the question of whether&nbsp;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;would give a definitive answer to the theory about Bucky’s sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;with GQ in May 2016, when asked about Bucky’s potential romantic angle with Captain America, Stan said, “It’s great” that people would relate to his on-screen character in that way. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He explained movies are for the audience, and they could interpret them in the way they want. However, he revealed that he never thought of his character in that way. “But there’s no right or wrong answer,” he added.&nbsp;</p><h2>The First Episode of the Show Hinted at Bucky Being Bisexual</h2><p>Bucky’s bisexuality was also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hinted</a>&nbsp;at in the first episode of the show, titled “New World Order.”</p><p>In the episode, the character goes on a date with a server identified as Leah, who inquires about his love life in a future set after the events of&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame.&nbsp;“Have you dated much since half the fish in the sea came back?” she questions.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Bucky replies he had dated little, but he joined a dating app and came across a lot of “tiger photos.” He then elaborated: “I mean, tiger photos? Half the time, I don’t even know what I’m looking at, it’s a lot.”&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The "tiger" remark quickly gained&nbsp;fans’ attention&nbsp;because it might suggest that Bucky is canonically queer - tiger photos were common on dating apps like Tinder, and they were often associated with men’s profiles a few years ago.</p><p>However, the scene doesn’t outright confirm the theory surrounding the character’s sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>According to a recent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">article </a>in Digital Spy on March 26, 2021, the makers might be “queer-baiting” the audience - relucting&nbsp;to confirm or deny a character’s sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>If Bucky Barnes isn’t a case of “queer-bating,” The Falcon and the Winter Soldier‘s creative team are teasing the audience at this stage, particularly because the speculation has been going on for quite some time.</p><p>Nonetheless, it’ll be interesting to see where&nbsp;the show takes&nbsp;these subtle hints and clues in the remaining episodes.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The MCU show is&nbsp;directed&nbsp;by Kari Skogland and stars Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Emily VanCamp, Wyatt Russell, Noah Mills, Carl Lumbly, and Daniel Brühl. A new episode premieres every Friday exclusively on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnFmqOcp55irq%2BwjK2fnmWnnru1sdFmqqiklJ6ys3nSnpmaq6Serq950q2Yp2WSqrCsxYysnLGtkaG2tcWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
