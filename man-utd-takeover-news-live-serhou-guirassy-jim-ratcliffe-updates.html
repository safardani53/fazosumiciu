Arriving during the Covid-19 pandemic, he showed great resilience to settle at United under very stringent training conditions. Further resilience was required to cope with the setback of a long-term injury shortly after his arrival.</p><p>"So, a massive well done to Willy, and, of course, well done to the multitude of staff that have played a significant role in recruiting, developing and supporting him through challenging times.</p><p>"There is more work to be done for Willy to establish himself in the professional game.
