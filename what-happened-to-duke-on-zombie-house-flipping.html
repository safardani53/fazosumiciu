Folks just can't enough of their home renovation shows — and there are tons of them on air, like Zombie House Flipping on A&E.
Fans of the show have become super invested in the program but noticed a cast OG wasn't around in more recent episodes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It seems that he's left the show but he hasn't left house flipping. He still "rescues" wrecked homes and then turns them for a profit, but he's just not doing it on camera anymore.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And if you take a look at his social media handles, it's clear to see that he didn't decide to be on camera anymore for lack of talent...the guy is a seriously amazing homemaker and some of the abodes he's helped to create are just stunning to behold.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It looks like Duke is doing well for himself outside of 'Zombie House Flipping.'</h2><p>Although there's definitely money to be made as on-camera talent in a show, Duke may've just decided that the amount of time he was spending filming Zombie House Flipping wasn't worth his while. Either that or maybe he used his time on the show to promote his own business, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hour Glass Homes</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>His Instagram profile reads: "I enjoy creating beautiful spaces, traveling, learning, and new challenges" and he regularly posts to social media to show off his great work.</p><p>What's really interesting too is how he uses modern design philosophies tailor made to customers' personalized tastes. Just check out the two bathrooms in these posts below.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Or sometimes he demonstrates little touches to add a bit more domestic, "homey" flair to a house that'll make it look less like a commercial building and more like a home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>You can catch new episodes of Zombie House Flipping (without Duke) on A&E Saturdays at 11 AM or on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AETV.com</a>.
