Much like the recent sale, she suffered a two hundred thousand dollar loss on that deal too.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At the time, she also had one Nyack home in contract with three more properties on the market. One month before that sale, she sold her West Palm Beach, Florida, home for $5 million .&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>A source close to O’Donnell reported to NY Post that she had no use for all the extra space since she acquired her $8 million triplex penthouse at 255 E. 29th St. Prior to that, she had sold her Greenwich Village penthouse at 130 W. 12th St. for $9 million&nbsp;in 2014.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She also put another part of the same compound which had five homes on 2.4 acres just 40 minutes from Midtown Manhattan, on the market for $10.79 million&nbsp; in November 2017.&nbsp;</p><h2>She Made Her Fortune On-screen</h2><p>Her extensive realty portfolio makes her massive $120 million&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a>&nbsp;easier to swallow.&nbsp;</p><p>O’Donnell, born in Commack, Long Island, New York, made her fortune through her TV appearances, most notably as a host on&nbsp;The View&nbsp;and her talk show&nbsp;The Rosie O’Donnell Show. However, her Hollywood roots trace back to Star Search, which gave her the limelight she needed to make it into TV sitcoms.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Making her debut in the 1986 show Gimme a Break,&nbsp;she joined VH1 as a veejay in 1988, followed by a hosting gig on Stand-up Spotlight on the same platform. By the time her 1992 sitcom Stand By Your Man caught wind, her feature film debut was making headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>She started her silver screen career alongside stars like Tom Hanks, Madonna, and Geena Davis. Since then, she has been gathered acting credits in titles like&nbsp;Sleepless in Seattle&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;Exit to Eden&nbsp;(1994), Beautiful Girls (1996), Wide Awake&nbsp;(1998), and Tarzan&nbsp;(1999).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>By 2011, she had begun producing content on the much-coveted Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), where she lent her talent on shows like&nbsp;The Doc Club with Rosie O'Donnell (2011), Becoming Chaz&nbsp;(2011),&nbsp;Miss Representation (2011),&nbsp;and The Rosie Show (2011). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apart from her celebrated career on-screen, she has also made a name for herself as a publisher.
