But it seems he still hasn’t learned the importance of just going quietly and follow the officers’ orders.
Ryan was arrested twice back in February, and he was sentenced to inpatient rehab for the first of those charges.
He made the unfortunate decision to leave rehab ahead of schedule, and to the surprise of absolutely no one Edwards was picked up for DUI and drug possession shortly thereafter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I got evidence. This is crazy. The officer said I can move my stuff out… I’ve been to my house, I saw what was done to it,” an irate Edwards ranted.</p><p>Asked who might have trashed the place, Ryan alleged that it must have been Mackenzie’s new boyfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“The person that is with her I guess. I stayed at my parents’ house. I left my mom and dad’s house. That’s what I saw Thursday. It was like that yesterday. I have my camera and SD cards,” Ryan claimed.</p><p>“Why would I destroy my own stuff?” he continued.</p><p>“That’s a good question. I’ve been wondering the same thing,” said one arresting officer.</p><p>“Do you not think she’s lying?” Ryan said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“[Mackenzie] has an order of protection against me. She’s called you guys three times. Three times I have not done anything to her.”</p><p>At that point one of the cops explained to Ryan that he’s being taken into custody for the very simple reason that a warrant was issued for his arrest, and knowing that, he failed to turn himself in.</p><p>“You were told you had a warrant and you didn’t do anything about it. That’s it. OK?” said the cop</p><p>Ryan then struggled and yelled “get off!” as police patted him down and found drugs in his vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As for the trashed house, well — there’s video of that too.</p><p>And Ryan’s “why would I wreck my own stuff?” excuse doesn’t really hold water, as the cops in that footage note that Mackenzie’s stuff was ruined and Edwards’ was left alone.</p><p>“Funny how that works, isn’t it?” said one of the officers in the footage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At the time of his arrest, officers noted that Ryan looked to be spattered in the same paint that had been used to vandalize his home.</p><p>“Upon searching Mr. Edwards, I observed white paint on the tops and sides of his boots which appeared to match what I observed on the floor of the Edwards residence,” reads the arrest report.</p><p>So yeah, Ryan is almost certainly going to receive a lengthy prison sentence.</p><p>And frankly, it can’t happen soon enough.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WBcL7YmqVmnZSsrrOw0maqnp2eYrOqs8etoKefXay2tbSMnKapq12eu26%2Fx6iapKGenHqvsdZmmKuqlajBbsLInZyoZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
