The short clip racked up over three million views in just six short hours, with many commenters wondering if she was freezing cold as her bare skin hit the snow! “OMG UR FREEZING IN THE SECOND,” one fan wrote. “UR PROBABLY FREEZING NOW I CANT,” another added. “I’m sure this was cold haha,” a third pondered.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Nina didn’t share her exact location, she appears to be enjoying the winter getaway with boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shaun White</strong></a>, 35. The couple, who began their romance during the initial COVID-19 quarantine in 2020, snuggled up for a sweet selfie in a photo dump shared by the Canadian actress on Jan. 4. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Vampire Diaries alum</a> stunned with a red lipstick as she bundled up in a white winter jacket and knit, patterned toque, while the pro snowboarder opted for a chunky black turtleneck and coat.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“snow daze,” she wrote alongside the images, that also showed her having a blast in the matching beanie and sweater set! Her adorable rescue dog<strong> Maverick</strong> was also along for the ride, proudly posing with his mama in the snow. The Border Collie-Australian Shepherd mix, who Nina adopted from The Pet Care Foundation in Los Angeles in 2017, also stayed bundled up in a very own black parka of his own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye49wZqehnpZ6pbvBq5yvZaKasW6uyKSgp6FdqLuww4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
