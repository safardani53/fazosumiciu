The first occurred during her Los Angeles show in October 2022, when she poked fun at her <a href=#>alleged love triangle</a> with <a href=#><strong>Joshua Bassett</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong></a>.</p><p>“I’ve got a great personality but no tits,” she sang in the track’s outro. “This song is not about Joshua Bassett /Los Angeles your energy is big d–k.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sabrina-Carpenter-Reveals-What-Inspires-Her-Nonsense-Outros-2.jpg><p>In May, Carpenter went viral again for her NSFW request for her birthday <a href=#>following rumors</a> she was <a href=#>romantically linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Shawn Mendes</strong></a>. Instead of singing, Carpenter told her fans to lip-read her next line and mouthed that she wanted “d—k please.” The following day, Carpenter tweeted<a href=#> she “wasn’t” joking</a> about her request.</p><p>After wrapping up her solo tour, Carpenter has joined <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> for the Latin American portion of her <a href=#>Eras Tour </a>which kicked off in Mexico City on Thursday, August 24.</p><p>“[Taylor] is one of my main inspirations, ever since I was a little girl,” Carpenter gushed to Billboard on Monday. “And now to just be able to watch that whole show every night is going to be so special and I feel so lucky that we get to go to all those places we get to go with her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As Carpenter takes the stage as the opening act of the Eras Tour, she continues to produce her iconic outros. During her first show in Mexico, Carpenter gave fans a taste of her sass and adoration for Swift, 33. “I only date him if he pays mi rente / If you are a Swiftie, you’re mi gente / Let me hear you make some noise, DF,” she sang while shouting out the city’s nickname.</p><p>“Eras Tour lol WOW. Mexico City nights 123 you have been the most welcoming incredible crowds I can’t believe how lucky I am to play for u,” Carpenter wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Sunday, August 27, after playing her third show. “@taylorswift :’) love u to the moon and to saturn I will never forget this weekend ♡ ♡ See you tonight NIGHT 4.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqamqKeu6J5wpqpqZ2eqbKzec6nZK2glWK2r7%2FPoqmarJmku26uxKGgp5xdnbKzec2opaydnqiybrvUramoq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
