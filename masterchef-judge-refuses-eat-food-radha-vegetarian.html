"I'm really enjoying this dish."</p><p>Fans were left baffled as the amateur chefs served up dishes including steamed cod, chicken and octopus, which Radha avoided.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Taking to Twitter, one fan hit out: "Imagine inviting someone on to judge that doesn't eat meat or fish when everyone's cooked it?"</p><p>"Why are they inviting a vegetarian to judge meat? Are they going to invite someone with a peanut allergy to judge a nut roast?" a second said.</p><p>"Why on earth do you have a judge on master chef who is a vegan no fish or meat?

If she's veggie she can't taste all the dishes. Pointless, really," a sixth concluded.</p><p><strong>Masterchef airs Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays at 8pm on BBC One</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpiZYF4fpJuZqaZo6mys6%2FHnp1moqWZtKZ50Z6drquVqHqmrdNmnainlGK%2ForDHmmSvnZeawaK%2ByJqlaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
