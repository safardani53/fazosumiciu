The alcoholic lemonade took revellers by storm when it first hit the shelves in 1995. And now it's been given a super charge with Soopa Hooch, the brand's first ever energised version of the classic which comes in three zesty flavours.
Caffeinated with taurine and guarana, Soopa Hooch is a party starter like no other - and it also offers great value at £2."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here's four essentials to party like it's 1999:</p><ul><li>You have to get the tunes right and you can't get more 90s than a bit of dance. Music from the decade is still hugely popular with the Biggest 90s Disco concerts attracting tens of thousands of revellers, most recently last weekend in Glasgow. So crank up some 2 Unlimited and Vengaboys and get the party started<br></li><li>Looking back the 90s never seemed like a classic decade for fashion but many of the trends are back. Bellbottoms, bum-bags and bike shorts are all back on the catwalks. So dig out your best 90s clobber - from matching plaids to tattoo chokers - and dress for the decade</li></ul><ul><li>No 90s night was complete without a bottle of Hooch. And now it's not just the original, zingy lemon on offer, you can enjoy once of the new citrussy flavours or even supercharge your night in with a Soopa Hooch. Meanwhile, Reef is another fun 90s classic you can purchase online from Good Time In.&nbsp;It’s an easy-to-drink still alcoholic orange and passion fruit drink you can enjoy as a base in cocktails, served in long drink recipes or simply over ice<br></li><li>Getting the decor right is key. Think bright colours and a bit of pazzazz, right out of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air credits. And if you want to push the boat out, toe together strings of old CDs - whether they be Oasis or Spin Doctors - and make some seriously cool hanging decorations<br></li></ul><p>Hooch&nbsp;is a classic loved by its army of drinkers and the latest twists on this classic can are sure to impress.</p><ul><li>Pick up Hooch at your local convenience store and online via <a href=# aria-label="Good Time In (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Good Time In</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Exclusive_Pic_4_-_Wings_Pink_backgroundjpg-JS678450554.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FtbXJrYGyEcMDRopydZaOkvLGtjKGmqJuYYrOtrdWorKurXanEqr%2FTZnBpq12YuaK%2F0qKaaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
