One effective tool to keep on-hand is a weighted blanket.

"Pressure therapy is shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which tells the body to rest and relax," says Dr. Williams. "Activating the parasympathetic nervous system also lowers anxiety and stress, helps to slow heart rate, helps with insomnia, and helps promote relaxation.” When shopping for your first weighted blanket, Dr. Williams advises to look for a blanket that’s about 10 percent of your body weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To get you started, PEOPLE Tested put 35 weighted blankets to work — keep reading to discover which ones passed our tests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-threshold-microplush-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3imjCiANnWK2nnmfnk_cR8kvp5Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/target-threshold-microplush-weighted-blanket-4144969b467542aba00cbbefcf1e3571.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Microplush fabric is of the coziest materials we tested</p></li><li readability=0><p>Easy to clean, both spot-cleaning and machine laundering</p></li><li readability=-1><p>One of the more affordable options</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our tests, we found a lot of things we loved about this blanket from Target. First and foremost, the fleece material is very soft and cuddly, which was especially great for winter (although we warn it may be a little too warm after using it for an extended period of time, but this is more a personal preference). We also like the convenience of the cover being machine washable. During testing, we splashed the blanket with coffee and then washed the cover according to the care instructions — and it came out looking good as new, despite the thickness of the blanket. It was also easy to spot clean, which is convenient for in-between washes in the machine. To top it all off, the Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket costs well under $100, making this a great value for a 15-lb. weighted blanket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>55 x 80 inches (15 lbs.) | <strong>Material: </strong>Microplush | <strong>Fill: </strong>88% glass microbeads, 12% polyester | <strong>Cover: </strong>Removable and machine washable throw</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4380 data-sizes=750px alt="Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Gvteb1riaeIQzTOVhUT-abMogUA=/fit-in/1500x4380/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-threshold-microplush-target-dburreson-451.jpg-e2feba05c16643bc88a53a17f416f31a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3511 data-sizes=750px alt="Threshold Microplush Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/jzIVPtgQhLpisE1WEPqxdSTt8Vk=/fit-in/1500x3511/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-threshold-microplush-target-dburreson-463.jpg-291f4aadd25b452992cec1b01a8cbf83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-waowoo-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Waowoo Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Waowoo Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/eEMp3uMDNgtaWH9DK6hIg9vK73Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-waowoo-adult-weighted-blanket-4497a828738342939439960ba3fc27eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Not super easy to machine wash, as we saw shrinkage and it takes awhile to air-dry</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Not as plush of a material as others we tested — we wish it was softer</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested the 15-lb. option from Waowoo, and we felt this weight to be perfect — heavy enough, but also easy to adjust and very comfortable. It’s nice and warm but does not trap body heat, keeping you at a nice temperature while using. The glass bead filling is evenly distributed, thanks to the quilted sewing pattern that keeps the beads in place. Plus, the blanket is available in several different weight options and sizes, so you can find exactly what you need here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did notice a few loose threads, but otherwise feel like it was very good quality. In our coffee spill test, a lot of the liquid came out with spot cleaning, and after laundering, we did notice some shrinkage but the stains did come out. When laundering, it also takes a long time to air-dry, so plan accordingly if using daily. We do wish it was a softer, more plush material, but it's still comfortable and not at all itchy. Overall, this a good value for such a low price point (even more so when on sale).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>60 x 80 inches (15, 17, 20, or 25 lbs.), plus other sizes | <strong>Material: </strong>Microfiber | <strong>Fill: </strong>Glass beads | <strong>Cover: </strong>Removable, machine-washable duvet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heavy-quility-weighted-blanket-with-soft-cover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Heavy</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quility Weighted Blanket with Soft Cover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quility Weighted Blanket with Soft Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YyHI8LVoDuR-fDeZsfXv2pXQN3E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quility-weighted-blanket-with-soft-cover-dba4cb15b32245b2b6d62c77fe1d3037.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Evenly distributed pressure that does not feel overly heavy</p></li><li readability=0><p>Durable, machine-washable cover</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Several colors to choose from</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Quility blanket felt soft on both sides. While there were some loose strings near the zipper, that was the only flaw that our tester noticed. The weighted insert was removable and is attached at the corners of the cover, which is a nice touch. It’s durable, too — our coffee stain came right out and the cover held up well after washing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even though this blanket weighs in at 25 lbs., it did not feel too heavy, and the pressure felt evenly distributed — meaning the weight did not cluster or shift while moving around. We felt warm after just five minutes under this blanket, making it a good choice for someone who keeps their place cool (but may be too warm for those who run hot, especially in the warmer months). Overall, this is a great choice for someone looking for heavier weighted blanket with evenly distributed weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>60 x 80 inches (25 lbs.), plus other weights and sizes | <strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton | <strong>Fill: </strong>Glass beads | <strong>Cover: </strong>Removable, machine-washable duvet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-nest-bedding-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nest Bedding Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nest Bedding Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dGAqGNcAX-hMIZR39OIul5cM2s4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nest-bedding-weighted-blanket-87bc437815cd45bdad3d37bcb6d0595d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nest Bedding</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>Fill stays in place and doesn’t shift around much, thanks to the quilted design</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Comes with a tote bag for travel or storage</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Stains easily come out with blotting and a Tide pen<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the more aesthetically pleasing blankets we tested, this one from Nest has a nice texture and feel, and the weight felt just right — noticeable when moving the blanket around but still manageable. Beautiful to look at, the blanket lays smooth and flat. We like that it's heavy enough to feel relaxed but it didn't trap in heat, keeping us comfortable while using. We loved that the fill didn't shift no matter how much we moved the blanket around; however, we did note that in some places, we could feel the tiny bumps of the fill — but it’s a small ding in an otherwise good review for comfort and quality.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When cleaning our coffee stain in our tests, most of the liquid ran right off the blanket. For the remaining stain, blotting and a Tide stick worked well. After laundering, however, the blanket came out with a hole and some loose threads. Aside from this issue, we found it to be a very good value — especially since it comes with a travel-ready tote. We would just advise against laundering it in the washing machine or taking extra care if you do choose to do so.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>48 x 72 inches (15 lbs.), 60 x 80 inches (18 lbs.), 80 x 86 inches (25 lbs.) | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester jersey top layer, woven polyester lining, bamboo rayon bottom layer | <strong>Fill: </strong>85% glass beads, 15% polyester fiber</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Nest Bedding Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5w5TfbOtDyLE0EPgJcm_o9zPmF8=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-nest-bedding-dburreson-307.jpg-8e3fa53d05d04e80aeff5357a5ca9fe1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Nest Bedding Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/k33GRykermy12RfJb0kPGoFJ3k0=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-nest-bedding-dburreson-328.jpg-0c98de143de14c718fce65a2bbee6811.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-knit-bearaby-cotton-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Knit</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bearaby Cotton Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bearaby Cotton Napper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wiydZh0rMHoT5nX5lgwdcKZx9QA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bearaby-cotton-napper-weighted-blanket-780c1597d8104780a57ee2d67e242402.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bearaby</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Open weave allows for good airflow, ideal for hot sleepers</p></li><li readability=1><p>Comes in several weight, size, and color options</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Kept its shape and quality after machine washing</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Different than most weighted blankets, the Bearaby Cotton Napper features a knit construction versus a bead-filled interior. We found the fabric to be soft, the knitting to be uniform, and the blanket well-constructed. It’s easy to move around underneath it, with the feel being similar to a heavy comforter, and it's easy to pick up and move around, as well. We would ideally recommend this blanket for hot sleepers, because the large knit allowed air to flow through and keep us warm without overheating. Spot cleaning wasn’t the easiest due to the knit material, but it did fare well in the wash. With a higher retail price than most of our winners, it’s a little spendy — but if you're a weighted blanket lover that runs hot, we definitely think it's worth the investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>40 x 64 inches (10 lbs.), 40 x 72 inches (15 lbs.), 45 x 72 inches (20 lbs.), 48 inches x 72 inches (25 lbs.) | <strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2858 data-sizes=750px alt="Bearaby Cotton Napper on white chair in a living room setting" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/F0FfB7abUtXyNZA6npvQCR09CpU=/fit-in/1500x2858/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_BearabyCottonNapperatBearaby-DB_006-b63aa3ce6c5c4a9f9a811867d2cb6f43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Person using stain remover pen on Bearaby Cotton Napper" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/E_5bsfRsUUs6hJojLdUuHUAoVKw=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/weighted-blanket-test-bearaby-cotton-napper-dburreson-129-d83ef263de164a8faaba663ef5a3540a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-washable-sunday-citizen-snug-crystal-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Washable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/gepWXUeXArkOBMpbV_Xu4snDGq0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunday-citizen-snug-crystal-weighted-blanket-b51435250c3f4d32a4c0967f798aab78.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunday Citizen</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Filled with calming crystal pieces</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Super easy to clean for both blotting and machine laundering</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Warm but still fairly breathable</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Messy people and those with kids and/or pets: This might just be the blanket for you. We found that in our coffee spill test, the liquid beaded and stayed on top of the blanket for over a minute, then completely disappeared like magic when blotted with a towel. Having blotted a lot of stains in our life, this amazed us. Plus, the outer shell is machine washable for added convenience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved that the super-soft microfiber exterior has a slight basket weave texture to it, which adds a nice decorative touch — not to mention that it's filled with bits of clear quartz, rose quartz, and amethyst crystals. The 10-lb. blanket felt like just the right weight and comfort when lying underneath, but it did feel quite heavy and cumbersome to move while folded. While it was very cozy and warm, it did not trap body heat and kept us comfortable during use. Starting at $269, it’s pricey for a blanket, even a great performing one, but we still think it's worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>52 x 77 inches (10 lbs.), 52 x 77 inches (15 lbs.), 52 x 77 inches (20 lbs), 90 x 90 inches (35 lbs.) | <strong>Material: </strong>100% microfiber | <strong>Fill: </strong>Glass pearls, polyester, pieces of clear quartz, rose quartz and amethyst | <strong>Cover:</strong> Removable, machine-washable</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3782 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8n8LiC1nda4NAYvJ-KczGrdFJ0E=/fit-in/1500x3782/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-sunday-citizen-snug-crystal-dburreson-147.jpg-16d49c43d8644794971828f221d37828.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4388 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket being tested." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/PT5dJ9fVDKm4ZpPWow4X17wpE94=/fit-in/1500x4388/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-weighted-blanket-test-sunday-citizen-snug-crystal-dburreson-156.jpg-ea01c9f50ed349a1ac856ff546709df6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-saatva-organic-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saatva Organic Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saatva Organic Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/EJl7EwPMLopYz-fD--fgxqLkuns=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/saatva-organic-weighted-blanket--c2b71616a6a7428699cfd32b5770b8bb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saatva&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>Excellent quality and comfort</p></li><li><p>Very easy to spot clean</p></li><li readability=0><p>Good temperature for year-round use, especially if you run cold</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Dry cleaning recommended, which can be inconvenient (and add to the cost over time)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Velvet fabric is not as plush as other materials we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking to splurge on a weighted blanket knowing it will last you a long time, this Saatva option is very high quality with nice, evenly distributed weight. The velvet material is as soft and plush as others we tested, but that just might be your preference. We were able to move it around easily, and the blanket remained nice and warm, perfect for three seasons — plus summer if you’re someone who runs cold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since the cover is not removable, dry cleaning is recommended — but this is a bit inconvenient for a 12- or 20-lb. blanket. So, we were happy to discover that it's super easy to clean by hand. When we spilled coffee on it during testing, the liquid rolled off in little beads, allowing a nearly effortless cleanup. Plus, it appears to be quite durable as the material won’t snag from everyday use. While it is expensive, we think it is fairly priced for the quality, comfortable feel, and durability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 48 x 74 inches (single, 12 lbs.), 86 x 92 inches (queen/king, 20 lbs.) | <strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton velvet | <strong>Fill material:</strong> All-natural glass beads</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-temperature-control-sleep-number-true-temp-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Temperature-Control</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sleep Number True Temp Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sleep Number True Temp Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sbEk_C1WpXrbALSYXc0Keb3V6GQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sleep-number-true-temp-weighted-blanket-e11dc80721e144efbdc2ed9046dacaf7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sleep Number</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Cooling, temperature-regulating fabric</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Weighted insert inside the cover doesn't shift or bunch up</p></li><li><p>Easy to spot clean</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Sleep Number blanket got top scores in the quality, comfort, and warmth categories during our tests, but what stands out is its temperature-regulating benefits. According to the brand, the proprietary fabric claims to adapt to your body's temperature via a particle technology that helps remove moisture and keep you from overheating. During our tests, we felt this actually worked — it's surprisingly cooling even after using for awhile or when the climate is warmer, and it's even comfortable enough to wear overnight without getting too hot. We also appreciated that the Sleep Number blanket has a washable cover, although it was also easy to spot clean with a damp cloth. In our machine washing test, the blanket did shrink somewhat, but we still believe it’s a durable choice; it feels like it would hold up to wear and tear in the long run, despite this slight shrinkage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>48 x 70 inches (12 or 20 lbs.) | <strong>Material:</strong> 80% cotton, 20% 37.5 polyester technology | <strong>Fill: </strong>94% glass beads, 6% polyester | <strong>Cover:</strong> Removable, machine-washable</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-kids-topcee-weighted-blanket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Kids</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TOPCEE Weighted Blanket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TOPCEE Weighted Blanket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tjNG-M1XxLrWK4oYhSZYH6_hZ2s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-topcee-weighted-blanket-c82bf08cd3a644feb0ea7cd2770666d3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This 3-lb. weighted blanket is a super soft, gentle option perfectly suited for kids. As an adult, you might want more weight, but the lighter weight is well-suited for a child who may need a little help falling asleep. While there’s a good amount of warmth, it's probably not warm enough for more frigid temperatures, but we love that the lighter weight and smaller size make for easy cleanup (although it's hand wash only, we found it easy to spot clean with a damp washcloth).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>36 x 48 inches (3 lbs.), plus other sizes and weights for adults | <strong>Material: </strong>Microfiber | <strong>Fill:</strong> 0.8-1 mm non-toxic hypo-allergenic glass beads</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-weighted-blankets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Weighted Blankets</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight and Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Bridget Cole Williams</a>, board-certified family physician and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Green Harvest Health</a>, says that a blanket roughly 10 percent of your body weight will provide best results for comfort, calmness, and ease in falling asleep. If you are in between sizes, Dr. Williams suggests going 1-2 lbs. above the suggested weight. “The idea is to feel the comfort and hugging sensation without pressure and difficulty moving,” she says. In terms of blanket size, she suggests choosing a blanket that is appropriate for your height instead of something that covers the size of your bed.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size and Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The fabric you choose is much more up to your senses and desire," says Dr. Williams. She advises to consider the climate you live in, the fabric's breathability and if you typically run hot or cold, and which textures and materials you find comforting. "Some common fabrics are minky, cotton, bamboo, flannel, linen, and microfiber,” she explains. There are also blankets with other elements, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sunday Citizen Snug Crystal Weighted Blanket</a> which is filled with pieces of crystal for added calming effects.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pricing</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Things like a removable, washable cover, cozy materials, and durable quality will all drive up the price of a weighted blanket. But if you can afford it, a higher-priced weighted blanket can definitely be worth it. For example, the most expensive option that we tested is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Saatva Weighted Blanket</a>, which costs $345 for 12 lbs. of weight.

We then timed ourselves lying under each blanket for five minutes, taking note of the blanket trapped heat and if they felt cool, warm, or overheated in this initial use. We also pulled the blanket up and rolled over underneath it to test how it felt while moving around, along with folding and pulling the blanket up on a bed to evaluate its maneuverability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Next, we determined how easy it was to spot-clean each blanket by pouring one tablespoon of coffee on the blanket, letting it stand for 30 seconds, then blotting with a cool, wet towel. If the stain remained, we treated the spot with a Tide pen. Machine washable blankets and covers were put through the wash as well to evaluate their durability after laundering.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, we rated each blanket on a 1-5 scale against each attribute (quality, comfort, warmth, ease of cleaning, durability, and — only after all the testing and then revealing the price — value). After the initial testing, we brought the blankets home with us for long-term testing, gathering more insights after one, three, and six months of use. The products with the highest average scores across all attributes made it to this PEOPLE Tested list of the best weighted blankets.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-e9627818-45bc-4be6-a739-78f74bbb06fa></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you sleep with a weighted blanket or use it during the day while relaxing?</span></p><p>"There is no right or wrong time to use your blanket," says Dr. Williams. "Whenever a sensory tool is needed to help with calmness, a weighted blanket can be used along with deep breathing, sensory toys, or grounding. A weighted blanket is another tool to help the body relax and may help with focus while working.” Keep in mind, however, your body's typical temperature level when sleeping — some weighted blankets may be too hot for you to use for an extended amount of time.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can children use weighted blankets?</span></p><p>Dr. Williams says weighted blankets are an excellent tool for children, especially those with autism, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
