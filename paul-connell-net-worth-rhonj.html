Paul finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debuted in Season 13</a> at the RHONJ husbands’ photoshoot during the February 2023 premiere.</p><p>Although Paulie is new to the Bravo universe, he spent most of his life building his impressive net worth. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several reports</a>, Paulie’s net worth is $1-2 million, which he has earned from running his own business since 2010.</p><p>Paul’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram bio</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> state that he is an entrepreneur who has worked in the lighting and electrical industry since 2001. The father of two worked as the vice president of All-Star Electrical Services from January 2001 until June 2010.</p><p>Paul has been the president and CEO of his companies, Eco Lighting Products LLC and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eco Electrical Services LLC</a>, since 2010 and reportedly still runs both businesses.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Paul Connell</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Entrepreneur, President, and CEO of Eco Lighting Products LLC and Eco Electrical Services LLC.</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $2 million</p><p>Paul “Paulie” Connell is an entrepreneur who appeared on ‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey.’ Paul is currently dating ‘RHONJ’ star Dolores Catania.</p><p><strong>Birth Date:</strong> June 27, 1982</p><p><strong>Birth Place:</strong> Dublin, Ireland</p><p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Dolores Catania (d. 2021)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Sons Kameron and Brooklyn</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> St. Marks School, Springfield Tallaght Ireland</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Connell has a stunning house he purchased with his millions.</h2><p>In addition to Paul obviously working hard, Dolores’s man also knows how to spend his earnings. During a Season 13 episode, “Coffee Talk,” Dolores offered to host <a href=#>Jennifer Aydin</a>’s coffee reading group lunch. The event was held at Paulie’s decadent house filled with a gorgeous kitchen, pristine living areas, and a beautiful outdoor patio where the ladies gathered before their table read.</p><p>When Dolores’s castmates — Margaret Josephs, Danielle Cabral, Rachel Fuda, <a href=#>Jennifer Fessler</a>, <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a>, and Jackie Goldschneider — arrived at the house, they couldn’t stop discussing how gorgeous Paul’s home was. Jennifer Fessler told Dolores that Paul would only have to look in her direction for her to risk it all and move into the house with her co-star’s man.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Other stars, like Melissa, relished in how Dolores managed to snag another beau willing to give her the finer things in life. Since Dolores joined RHONJ, two of her exes — Frank and her ex, <a href=#>David Principle</a> — bought her a house, and now Paulie is offering his home on a platter.</p><p>“Dolores is doing something right,” Melissa says in a confessional during the episode. “Frank built her a house, David built her a house, and now she’s sittin’ pretty in this house. If we were playing Monopoly, Dolores is winning.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Although we don’t want to be all about the money, we must agree with Melissa! Here’s hoping Dolores will drop a “how-to” guide on finding a loving, wealthy man!</p><p>The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa62uIycpqemlaG5brrErWSwp6KptW6%2Bx6ilow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
