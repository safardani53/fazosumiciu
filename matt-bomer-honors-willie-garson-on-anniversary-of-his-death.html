I can’t believe it’s already been a year since this beautiful bald man that I can proudly call my dad passed away. Besides his head, I think I miss his laugh and smile the most,” <a href=#>he wrote via Instagram</a>. “Because I knew that whenever he was laughing, he wasn’t the only one laughing. He had a gift of being able to talk to literally anyone he came into contact with and make them either laugh or awkwardly smile from a joke he had probably just told them.”</p><p>Nathen, whom Garson adopted in 2010, confessed: “He wasn’t just my father, he was my best friend and a mentor before I even knew what that was. He inspired me when I was younger to be better than I ever thought I could and because of that I try to always do better. I would not be where I am today if not for him. I wouldn’t be who I am if not for him.”</p><p>The 21-year-old reminded his followers that “life comes and goes way too quick,” before asking them to “cherish everyone and say hi to a stranger every once in a while because you never know when you could meet your next best friend.” He added, “That’s how my dad met me. Thank you for all the lessons dad ❤️.”</p><p>Bomer was quick to respond to the touching post, replying, “Nathen this is beautiful. I miss him so so much. He could make me laugh and feel seen in a way that no one else could. I know he is so proud of the young man you have become. Sending you lots of ❤️ today.”</p><p>Garson’s Sex and the City costar <a href=#><strong>Kristin Davis</strong></a> also sent Nathen a message of support on the College of Wooster student’s hard day, writing, “Oh Nathen sending you all of our love! <a href=#>We are all going to be together today</a> and i feel him here with us. Thinking of all of the jokes he made the last time we did all of these things together . Thank you for this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Davis — who played Charlotte York alongside <a href=#>Garson’s Stanford Blatch on the HBO series</a> and its <a href=#>2021 spinoff And Just Like That</a> — reposted Nathen’s message on her own social media account on Wednesday as well.</p><p>“We will miss @Willie.Garson. Especially today,” the 57-year-old actress added via her Instagram Story. “Love you @Nathen_Garson.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSpeqO7zJ6pZqCfo7yzv4ywoKWkmZp6qK3RrKanZZ%2BjeqK6zaKtnqqjlr%2B6ec6fZKGho2Kxpq3ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
