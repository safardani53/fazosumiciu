Originally from Paxton, Illinois, the singer relocated to Sacramento shortly before auditioning for the program.
Regarding her inspiration to try out for The Voice, she often credits her father’s DJing career as her primary influence.
During the blind audition rounds of the show, Gina impressed judges Kelly Clarkson and Niall Horan with her rendition of Katy Perry’s The One That Got Away.
