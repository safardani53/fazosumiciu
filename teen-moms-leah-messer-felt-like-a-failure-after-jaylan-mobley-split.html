I needed to learn to trust my own intuition when something maybe doesn’t feel right or just isn’t working out.”</p><p class=p1>After one year of dating, Jaylan, 26, <a href=#>popped the question in August 2022</a>. The pair were <a href=#>engaged for only two months</a> before calling it quits.</p><p class=p1>“While the last year has been tremendously exciting for both of us, we’ve realized that it’s best we walk separate paths,” the former couple <a href=#>told <i>Us </i>in a statement in October 2022</a>. “We are so grateful for the lessons, growth, and memories we’ve had in this relationship. So many of you have watched our love story unfold, and we hope that you’ll continue to watch our stories while we move forward as friends.”</p><p class=p1>They added: “We will forever have love and respect for each other, and we ask for privacy as we refocus and transition out of this chapter together.”</p><p class=p1>While the duo <a href=#>claim to be on good terms</a> following their split, Leah — who shares twins Ali and Aleeah, 12, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Corey Simms</strong></a>, and daughter Adalynn, 9, with ex-husband<a href=#><strong> Jeremy Calvert</strong></a> —&nbsp; alleged during a July episode of<a href=#><i> Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </i></a>that Jaylan had “duped” her when he proposed by gifting her a fake house deed. She has since put her feelings about Jaylan “in the past” as she tries to “move forward.”</p><p class=p1>“I took some time for myself to<a href=#> rebuild my confidence and self-esteem</a> after that breakup and that relationship because I definitely took a hit from it,” she told <i>Us</i>. “But, overall, I mean, it’s fine [and] we’re in a great place. We’re cordial, we get along, and I think you’ll see that. You’ll see that in the season.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#>Leah’s daughters</a>, meanwhile, <a href=#>had their own bond with Jaylan </a>and have also had to grieve the breakup. “I think given the circumstances, honestly, the entire time during our relationship, it wasn’t traumatic at all,” she said. “So there was nothing really traumatic [about the split]. I mean, at the end, we just accept that not all of us are in a place to pursue a committed relationship. And that’s OK. … My kids are fine with it. I think at first it was like, ‘OK,’ and then, I mean, we’re fine. We’re happy, we’re healthy, and that’s all that matters.”</p><p class=p1>The pair’s split was featured on last season of <i>Teen Mom 2</i>, and will continue to play out on the latest batch of episodes. For Leah, it’s been difficult to rewatch the drama as it airs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Leah-Messer-%E2%80%98Felt-Like-a-Failure-After-Jaylan-Mobley-Split-But-It-Was-a-Blessing-in-Disguise3.jpg><p class=p1>“It was definitely challenging at the beginning, but I think we’ve moved forward and we’re in great places,” Leah told <i>Us</i> on Monday. “We both are and, in my case, I’m happy. And we’re just moving forward.”</p><p class=p1>While the MTV personality noted that it’s been “hard” to get her groove back, she<a href=#> isn’t quite ready to start dating again</a>. “I say that I give everyone the benefit of the doubt until you prove me wrong. I think my circle is extremely important to me — my circle meaning me and my children — so who I allow in, I <a href=#>want to choose wisely</a> about that,” she added. “But we’re growing and we’re learning and we make mistakes and we keep going.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter </i>airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZWjeq67zKxkpZ2RnXqusdKsnKtllpq5tXnLoqKeZZFis6K1y66pnmWRm8GmvoyjmLKkkaN6rrvBpZyyZaOluarAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
