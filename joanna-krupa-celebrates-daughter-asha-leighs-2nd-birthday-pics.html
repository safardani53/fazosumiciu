Amazing birthday ! Thank you @lisashawevents for taking my vision and again going way over and beyond!”</p><p>The reality star and her husband, <strong>Douglas Nunes</strong>, <a href=#>wed in August 2018</a>, announcing in May of the following year that they were starting a family.</p><p>“Hubby @nunes451 and I are beyond excited about this new chapter in our life and can’t wait to meet this little [baby],” the then-expectant star captioned an Instagram photo of<a href=#> her positive pregnancy test</a> in 2019.</p><p>From her <a href=#>baby shower</a> to her<a href=#> maternity shoot</a>, the Poland native continued documenting her pregnancy journey via Instagram.

I remember the days where I thought I had to lose weight cause there was always pressure to be perfect especially in my industry. Now I look back and I think my body was da bomb and would never take it for granted like I used to and if it ever looks this way again I will make sure to love it even more than before. Love yourself no matter what size shape or time u are in your life.”</p><p><a href=#>Asha-Leigh arrived in November 2019</a>, and<a href=#> Krupa showed Us the infant’s pink nursery</a> the following month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Once we found out it was a little girl, I just wanted [the room] to be a little princess-y, but I also wanted people to walk in and think it looked so soft and pretty and girly, not crazy over-the-top or cheesy,” the model explained in December 2019. “It’s girly, but not just for a baby. Even when my mom comes, there’s a daybed and she’s slept in there when my sister was in the other guest bedroom. It’s such a sweet room that any girl would want to sleep in there. I just wanted it warm, sweet and girly without being too crazy.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Asha-Leigh ringing in her second year, from her darling decorations to her colorful cake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt7CtzaeYZqOiqr2iecKeo56aopbBpr%2BMnZiun5ipsrN5wKyfmmWcmraotNJmaaecXZe2s8DHnZiyZaCesLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
