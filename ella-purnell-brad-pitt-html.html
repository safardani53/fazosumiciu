"Mostly because if I was a 21-year-old boy that just got a big part in a new show, nobody would have come out and said, 'He only got it because he's dating the female producer.'" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Purnell also noted that while she found it annoying, it was also hilarious.
