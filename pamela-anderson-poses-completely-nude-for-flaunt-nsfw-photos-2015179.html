She had a letter that said, ‘I’m not a lesbian, I just want to touch you.’ She got my bathing suit out of my room, I was there alone with two babies and I remember seeing a face in a window — isn’t it the scariest thing you can think of? You walk up to a dark window and you’re like [gasps]! I called security who couldn’t find her, and then she was in my house,” Anderson recalled. “Things kept going missing, ‘Where’s that loaf of bread? Where’s my jean jacket?,’ and I’d be like, ‘Am I going crazy?’ She was there for three or four days.”&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></p><p>“It’s in my safe,” she explained of her treasured garment. “I got one stolen when that [homeless] woman put it on, and when the police officer arrested her, they asked me if I wanted it back, and I said ‘No, no you can keep it.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapmZ2auaJ5wKebnqqjpLtuvM6snKxlk6S6sbjErZylsV2jwqWxjJ%2Bmq2WWoa62utNmpayep2K9qbvTqKpmamBmgnKDmGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
