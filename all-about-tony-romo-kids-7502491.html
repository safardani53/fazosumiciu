When Hawkins — nicknamed Hawk by his family —&nbsp;arrived, Romo's team the Dallas Cowboys shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>heartwarming statement</a> with fans: "Hawkins Crawford Romo is now a part of the Dallas Cowboys family."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the first child of the Crawford-Romo family, Hawkins' birth had a big impact on his parents. "If it's possible to bring you and your wife closer together, something like this really does," Tony told PEOPLE. "It's been a great blessing from God to put us in this situation. We feel very honored."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hawkins' uncle, actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chace Crawford</a>, also shared some words shortly after his birth.

That said, he's done more than cheer Tony on from the living room couch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Apart from visiting his father <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>at training camp</a>, Rivers has also joined the former quarterback behind the scenes as an NFL commentator for CBS. In November 2017, Candice shared photos on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Instagram Story</a> of the entire Romo family in the commentary booth at a game. Rivers wore his Dallas Cowboys No. 9 jersey with pride and was "already a natural" at pointing out particular plays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While he was the younger son in the family for a few years, Rivers later embraced his role as an older brother to Jones.

It's been really sweet to experience this pregnancy with them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Candice added: "They are very interested in the week-by-week baby calendar and how big the baby is getting.
