The presenter took issue with the Prime Minister's appearance after his address to the nation last night.
While Boris Johnson urged Black Lives Matter protesters to demonstrate peacefully, Piers questioned why no one had given the PM's hair a trim.
He even compared Boris to Worzel Gummidge - a character from a children's TV show in the 70s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I know it may seem trivial, but the rest of us, our wives, our partners, people we're with bothered to get the scissors out and give us a trim.</p><p>"I think the Prime Minister coming out like Worzel Gummidge - and I was told by 'sources close to the Prime Minister' last night that he hasn't seen a barber since early March, he has really fine hair and using a brush doesn't really tame it. It's not disrespectful, it's because hair dressers aren't open until July.</p><p>"But someone in that house must be able to trim it, Carrie? Carrie Symonds [the Prime Minister's partner] can she do it?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-Johnson-1.png><p>Susanna defended Carrie, who gave birth to the Prime Minister's child early this year: "Well Carrie's a little distracted at the moment."</p><p>Piers doubled down, saying: "I don't want the Prime Minister of the country to resemble Worzel Gummidge. And I don't really buy into the thin hair brushing thing.</p><p>"Because when he bothers to brush it, it looks quite kempt. And then some days he can't be bothered. I've actually seen him at parties deliberately ruffling to create the Boris look. I think it's disrespectful.</p><p>"You wouldn't see any other world leaders come out looking like Worzel Gummidge."</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-good-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bORIS-3.png></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-tweet-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-tweet-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-tweet-3.png></p><p>However, Good Morning Britain viewers were furious with Piers, with people labelling him disrespectful.</p><p>One person said: "Oh come on Piers Morgan, you have been so much better during this crisis than the Piers who kicks off over vegan slices - even dumped Trump. Don't make such a big deal about Bojo's hair. If it was cut, he would be accused of seeing a barber during lockdown. @piersmorgan #GMB"</p><p>Another added: "Nah sorry @GMB slagging off the #PrimeMinister is a low! Report news not what #PiersMorgan ideology of how he should be looking, it’s rather pathetic really #GMB"</p><p>A third said: "@piersmorgan #GMB Oh for goodness sake you are scraping the barrel now with your comnent about Boris’ hair. He was talking about a serious issue and instead of agreeing with him you moan about his hair REALLY !! Get a grip man"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Boris-Johnson-2.png><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV AND SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>Some people defended Piers' views, with one person saying: "Boris’ messy hair is hella disrespectful #gmb #GoodMorningBritain"</p><p>Another said: "MG Face with tears of joy Face with tears of joy Face with tears of joy waking up to see<br>@piersmorgan<br>comparing #BorisJohnson hair to #WorzelGummidge what a start to the morning... How funny #GMB"</p><p>It comes after Boris Johnson asked the nation to protest peacefully and respect social distancing in the wake of George Floyd's death.</p><p>His speech was a response to the protest in Bristol that saw the statue of slave trader Edward Colston torn down and more than 100 arrests.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Piers Morgan makes Susanna Reid laugh with impression of 'racist' viewers after he banned them from watching Good Morning Britain</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZWh9cnyOqaCeqqNiurC%2BxpqlZpqfp7a0ecmon6ern6N6qa3Iq2Swp6Kvsq15xq6kpqGUnLJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
