All three kids have dabbled a bit in the entertainment industry. Stephen revealed some advice he gave his kids in a January 2023 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>episode</a> of his show. “The advice I’ve given my kids just in general being in business is: be enthusiastic and competent,” he said.

The comedian was still working on his early career when Madeleine was born. He had previously joked about cradling his daughter in audition tapes, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;Stephen had also revealed that he had Evelyn had hired&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Garner&nbsp;</strong>to babysit for her early in their careers after both of the actors appeared on&nbsp;Spin City.&nbsp;Stephen and Jennifer reminisced on when the actress used to babysit for their daughter in a 2017 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Late Show</a>. “I just remember your gorgeous little girl,” Jennifer told Stephen. “She was really smart. She was very verbal.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>As a youngster, Madeleine did make an appearance on&nbsp;The Daily Show&nbsp;in a 2004 episode as the “Oil Industry in Disguise,” per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;She later worked as a makeup artist on&nbsp;The Late Show&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While her dad has always had a knack for making the news funny, some of the love of current events clearly inspired his daughter. Madeleine, who now goes by&nbsp;<strong>Madeleine Carlisle,&nbsp;</strong>is a working journalist. She had previously written for both&nbsp;The Atlantic&nbsp;and&nbsp;Time,&nbsp;according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> bio, and she’s now an associate producer at&nbsp;60 Minutes, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>, sharing the CBS network with her dad.</p><h2>Peter Colbert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Stephen-Colbert-Kids-embed-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Evelyn gave birth to her and Stephen’s second child Peter in 1998. The middle Colbert child has mostly stayed out of the spotlight, but he has dipped his feet into the entertainment industry. Given what a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>big fan of the&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</a>series his father is, it’s no surprise that the comedian seemed to pass on some of that love to his children, and Peter had a small acting role alongside his dad as a Laketown spy in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&nbsp;in 2013. He’s also acting in an upcoming short, called&nbsp;The Virgin,&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;Aside from acting, Peter does have some credits behind the camera. He directed the 2018 short&nbsp;At The Crossroads Down Yonder, which he also wrote, and an episode of the 2019 TV series&nbsp;Where’s Noah?&nbsp;which he also executive produced four episodes of. He was also listed as a cinematographer on a 2020 episode of&nbsp;The Late Show.</p><h2>John Colbert</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Stephen-Colbert-Kids-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Stephen and Evelyn welcomed their youngest child John in 2002. Like his older siblings, John has also dabbled a bit in entertainment. Like his brother and father, he also made an appearance in The Hobbit&nbsp;series as a Laketown spy also. Aside from&nbsp;The Hobbit&nbsp;cameo, he appeared in four shorts in 2019:&nbsp;Egg Evan, Real Detective, The Sockpocalypse,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cardboard By Your Name, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.
