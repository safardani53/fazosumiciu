This is no holds barred and it is the experience of a lifetime."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755878190.jpg><p>Although he was nervous about the nude shots - despite an earlier appearance on <a href=#>Naked Attraction</a> - Steven says having the avatar's before and after shots judged by the 50-strong panel was the most nerve-wracking part.</p><p>"That was scary as hell," he says. "I've been naked in front of people but they're judging you on your hang up.</p><p>"I didn't know if they're going to be body positive or they're going to be cutthroat but they were all so positive and warm.</p><p>"Their comments actually lifted my mood and made me feel good about myself."</p><h2>Hard choices</h2><p>The show sees Dr Sherif Wakil offering two options for surgery, as the avatar is adjusted to reflect the difference.</p><p>The first, suspensory ligament release, would mean cutting the ligament that attaches the penis to the pubic bone, meaning it hangs lower, adding an inch as it hangs lower, but Steven was told his erection would also hang lower than normal after the op.&nbsp;</p><p>The op - which comes in at between £2,500 and £5,000 - would also leave a scar and come with risks of complications.</p><p>Faced with the results many of the panel seem unimpressed, with actress Minnie saying: “You’d be left with a huge scar and that would be what my eye is drawn to, rather than the size of your penis.”</p><p>Entertainers LV and Ty, who compare his ripped body to a Spartan from the film 300, joke:&nbsp; “I think he’s taking the mick. He’s being greedy.”</p><p>The second suggested op involves the same cut but also injecting fat from his stomach into his member, to increase the girth by 20-30 per cent.</p><p>But Dr Wakil warns that sex too soon after the op could push the fat down to form a lump at the bottom.</p><p>Other risks included infection and a lumpy penis, which would mean a further corrective op.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000754472575.jpg><p>While Steven likes the look of the new appendage, the panel are mixed, with Minnie branding it “a deformed hot dog."</p><p>We can't reveal Steven's ultimate decision but he insists he's happy he took part and hopes the show will help others in his position.</p><p>"I've learned such a lot on the show and I'm now able to pass on a lot of information on to people with the same issue, because there's so much out there that can be done to help, if you are really unhappy with something.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"It's not unreachable, everyone can have tweaks if they really want to, and I think that's what's great about the show. It's body positive but also educational, helping people to make informed choices."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Send Nudes: Body SOS airs from Wednesday at E4 at 10.15pm</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ3fZVpbG9noKS%2Fr3nSrZirZaOau6V5za6bnqtdl7ylxYyspqxlpqS0trGMsKClpJmWurR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
