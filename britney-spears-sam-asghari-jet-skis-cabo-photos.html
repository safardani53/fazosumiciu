The actor, showing off his muscular frame in a swimsuit and tank top, helped the “Toxic” singer with her life vest before she rode off to catch some waves. Rocking a plain white tee and short shorts, Britney was ready for some fun in the sun!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Mexican getaway comes almost a week after the former Mickey Mouse Club star posed in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nothing but her birthday suit</a> for a set of racy snaps shared to social media. While the post appeared to be focused on her adorable puppy Sawyer, all eyes were on Britney’s figure as she was seen totally naked while holding her furry, four-legged friend. She ended the eye-popping album with an image of a dog and the somewhat inspirational quote, “If you love someone, set them free. If you hate someone, set them free. Basically set everyone free and get a dog. People are stupid.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Britney’s risqué reveal follows Sam recently sharing a video of the couple enjoying a hike along the coast. In it, the pair stopped to take in the gorgeous surroundings, with Britney rocking a hoodie and Sam in a tank top. “Beautiful day today,” the actor captioned the clip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The couple definitely love letting their fans see what a happy life they lead. In another recent example, Britney <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showed off their romance</a>&nbsp;when she posted a clip of them dancing and packing on the PDA. “<span class="_7UhW9 xLCgt MMzan KV-D4 se6yk T0kll">Thank you baby for always reminding me what life is about … Joy, laughter, and living… My experience was a woman’s dream,” the “Gimme More” singer captioned the video. Sam commented, “My life is a man’s dream.” Too cute!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BrZpuqmam7psWMrKeemaKoerStzGaYrJ%2BYlr%2Bqecmeq2arm57Abq%2FAm6ZmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
