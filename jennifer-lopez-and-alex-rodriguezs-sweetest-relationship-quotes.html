Since <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a> started dating in early February 2017, they have continued to gush over each other in one interview after the next — despite <a href=#>facing some ups and downs</a> along the way.</p><p>The Hustlers actress was previously married three times: to <a href=#><strong>Ojani Noa</strong></a> from February 1997 to January 1998, to <a href=#><strong>Cris Judd</strong> </a>from September 2001 to June 2002 and to <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a> from June 2004 to June 2014. Lopez and the “Te Amare” crooner welcomed twins Emme and Max in February 2008.</p><p>Rodriguez, for this part, finalized his divorce from <strong>Cynthia Scurtis</strong> in September 2008 after six years of marriage. The former couple share daughters Natasha, born in November 2004, and Ella, born in April 2008.</p><p>In the early days of their romance, Lopez and the retired MLB star made a concerted effort to blend their families. “If you want to be together, you are together,” Rodriguez told Extra in June 2017. “Our kids get along really well, we’re both from New York, we’re both Latin, we’re both in our 40s. We’re really enjoying life.”</p><p>Three months later, the “Dance Again” singer gushed about the security she felt after years of romantic woes. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time — I don’t know — maybe ever,” she said in a radio interview in September 2017. “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been [in] where I feel like we really make each other better.”</p><p>Lopez added: “We complement each other, and that’s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy.”</p><p>The New York natives took the next step in their relationship when <a href=#>Rodriguez popped the question</a> in March 2019. Though they hoped to tie the knot in the summer of 2020, the duo were<a href=#> forced to change their plans</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“J. Lo wants to marry A-Rod shortly after things go back to normal. She wants to marry him and celebrate their love in front of her family and close friends,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively in April 2020.</p><p>Nearly one year later, however, the pair hit a rough patch amid rumors that Rodriguez had been exchanging DMs with Southern Charm star <a href=#><strong>Madison LeCroy</strong></a>. The reality star told Page Six in February 2021 that <a href=#>she had “never been physical” with Rodriguez</a>, while sources close to the former pro athlete maintained that the pair had never even met.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>News broke in March 2021 that Rodriguez and the Second Act star had <a href=#>called it quits after four years together</a> — but the couple denied the split soon after. “All the reports are inaccurate. We are working through some things,” they said in a joint statement at the time.</p><p>Scroll down to see more of A-Rod and J.
