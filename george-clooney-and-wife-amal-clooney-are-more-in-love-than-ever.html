George, 62, was <a href=#>as handsome as ever</a> in a navy blue polo shirt and pin-striped pants. He paired the ensemble with tan loafers and stylish shades, waving to photographers as he and Amal, 45, approached the city’s famous canals.</p><p>Amal, for her part, looked effortless in a white shift dress with a modern floral design. She wore chic black kitten heels and large round sunglasses.</p><p>The pair, who <a href=#>live in Lake Como</a> full-time, will attend <a href=#><strong>Diane von Furstenberg</strong></a>‘s 14th annual DVF Awards on Thursday, August 31, where Amal will be honored with a leadership award for her human rights work.</p><p>Both the ceremony and other film festival events give George and Amal an excuse for “a fun date,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. “It’s so close to their home and they love catching up with friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/George-Clooney-and-Amal-Are-More-in-Love-Than-Ever-as-They-Step-Out-for-Stylish-Venice-Date-1.jpg><p>“George and Amal are more in love than ever,” the insider tells Us. “They can’t picture their lives with anyone else.”</p><p>Between the film festival and the DVF Awards, the duo’s Venice visit is a busy one. For the majority of the summer, however, they’ve tried to lay low and spend quality time with <a href=#>their 6-year-old twins</a>, Ella and Alexander.</p><p>“Amal has a big home office and is working on cases this summer, but both [she] and George really try to do life the European way and take August off from work,” the source adds, noting that George and Amal “have formed a real partnership” when it comes to parenting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/George-Clooney-and-Amal-Are-More-in-Love-Than-Ever-as-They-Step-Out-for-Stylish-Venice-Date-3.jpg><p>The couple’s comfortable dynamic has long been relationship goals for fans. Last year, George revealed yet <a href=#>another enviable detail</a> about his marriage to the acclaimed lawyer.</p><p>“We’ve never had an argument,” he claimed during a joint interview with Amal on a September 2022 episode of CBS Mornings, calling marriage “the easiest thing we have done in our lives thus far.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amal teased that her and George’s lack of disagreements is “madness” to some of <a href=#>their inner circle</a>. “I think that it’s 99 percent luck just to meet the right person,” she explained. “And I think the one thing we would take is to not be cynical, just to be open … and things just moved very quickly.”</p><p>She continued to gush over the pair’s love story, adding, “I met him, and I thought, ‘I’m so glad that there is someone like him in the world.’ I didn’t ever imagine that I would get to spend the rest of my life with him or that we would have this wonderful family. It took me by surprise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagnZ%2BntKZ5wqWmqKaVrnqiusNmrqKelWKurq3LZpqlp5%2Bjsrp5wKucZqWfp7Jutc1mo6iulWLBqa3NZpyvnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
