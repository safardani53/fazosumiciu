"You've seen our journeys and now we're together and you're going to see the engagement this season, and then for them not to film?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hubbard, 36, added: "Imagine if we were like, 'Alright, that's all you get from Carl and Lindsay.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While they're excited to give fans a glimpse into their wedding, Hubbard revealed that filming the nuptials is also bringing heightened expectations for their big day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If we were just getting married with all of our guests and friends that would be one thing," she explained.

"It's taken this long for us to come together — he's 38, I'm 36 — I don't think there is anybody in our lives that would let us get away with a small wedding, including Bravo."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the couple is still finalizing their guest list. Radke shared, "We're still working out the guest list. We have kind of an idea of numbers, but I don't know. We still have some time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August, PEOPLE exclusively broke the news that Radke had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>proposed</a> to Hubbard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reality star got down on one knee at Dune Beach in Southampton, New York, amid filming Summer House.
