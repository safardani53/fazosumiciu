However, the split was imminent, especially since the two didn't see eye to eye about starting a family.</p><p>"There's always been a rift," another source close to the actress tells<strong> Us</strong>. "Because he wanted kids and she didn't."</p><p>Westfeldt, 45, <a href=#>opened up to the New York Times</a> about the topic in more detail in 2012. "I never thought I'd be this age and not have kids," she reflected at the time. "But my life has also gone in a million ways I never anticipated. I kept feeling like I'd wake up with absolute clarity, and I haven't. And we have a pretty great life together… No one's had to give up an opportunity they really wanted."</p><p>In another interview with the Guardian, Westfeldt explained why marriage and kids weren't on her list of priorities. "In reality our lives — Jon's and mine — are so unconventional in every way, it's very difficult," she said that same year. "I think kids should have something grounded. Jon and I are both children of divorce."</p><p>Though the stars disagreed on the topic of kids, the nontraditional pair were always in agreement about their choice not to wed. "Neither of us have the greatest examples of marriages in our families," the Mad Men alum, 44, told Parade in 2010. "But Jen is the love of my life, and we've already been together four times longer than my parents were married."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In fact, they were in it for the long haul: Westfeldt even stood by the actor through his stint in rehab this past spring. Adds the second source: "He felt guilty because Jennifer stood by him for so long when he dealt with his alcoholism. It's sad."</p><p>For more details on Hamm's newfound bachelorhood, pick up the latest issue of <strong>Us Weekly</strong>, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp55itaK5zGahnqaenrOmvoywnKyslpq5pcCMsJ%2ByZaSdsrp50qmjoqxdZ31ygZhyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
