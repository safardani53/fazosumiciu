He spent his days traveling, fishing, and having fun.&nbsp;Looking through Daphne’s Instagram, @daphneoz, we notice her posting a photo of her brother on his birthday.</p><p>She claims that her younger brother is no longer a child.&nbsp;She also lauded him, calling him an explorer who had taken them on daring adventures and family farm days.&nbsp;Not only that, but Daphne referred to him as the Pied Piper to their children.&nbsp;Aside from that, we can witness her having fun with her spouse and children in various locations performing various things.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daphne-Oz-1.jpg alt="Daphne Oz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>“I had fought a lot with my Muslim identity,” says Mehmet Oz.</h2><p>When questioned about his religion and identity in one of his interviews, Mehmet stated having a struggle with his Muslim identity.&nbsp;He explained how there are only two viewpoints in his family. His mother’s family, he claims, is highly secular.&nbsp;They take pride in the fact that they are secular. Mehmet explains how Islam is both a religion and a law.&nbsp;In Turkey, your political leaders are also your religious leaders, he explained. He also describes how difficult the parting was in Turkey.</p><p>Mehmet claims that his mother’s family is very religious but keeps it hidden from others. He also discussed how his father was able to get the top medical education in the world during the 1940s. According to him, his father’s family is likewise considerably more conventional. Religion was their most valuable asset because it provided them with morals.&nbsp;So, Mehmet, given the context, says that as a Turk reared in America with one father who had religious barriers and one who did not, he was drawn more to the spiritual element of religion rather than the legal side of religion.</p><p>Mehmet claims that in his mind, he used religion as a playing field since the laws of the game felt like the rules of the game.&nbsp;He describes it as a 100-yard-by-30-yard field with a hash mark every ten yards, which he claims is just a rule, but the actual game is where you can include the other human connection, which he defines as a spiritual connection that defines his religious belief and describes who he is and what his relationship with the god is.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daphne-Oz-2.jpg alt="Daphne Oz" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mehmet acknowledged that he discovered this reality not only in Islam, but also in his father’s family, who is from Nashville, Tennessee.&nbsp;Finally, he addressed the fact that although Sufi Islam covers the idea of religion brilliantly, Mehmet finds the legal side of religion bothersome.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Daphne is a self-sufficient woman with a net worth of $12 million as of August 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmqiYo7Juu9lmmKWkXZavsMHTZquhnV2Zrrazx62cq2Wfm3quscemnK1ln698</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
