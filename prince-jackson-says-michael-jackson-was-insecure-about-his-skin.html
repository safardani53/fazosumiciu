I think the cause of it is up for speculation, but it’s either vitiligo or some form of lupus contributed to the vitiligo.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Mike Tyson</a></strong> mentioned that people thought Michael “was changing his skin because he wanted to be white, he was changing it because he wanted to glow. He wanted to be a light, he wanted to shine.”</p><p>The King of Pop’s <a href=#>eldest child</a>, 26, added that the condition caused his father anxiety.</p><p>“He had a lot of insecurity around, kind of looking blotchy in his appearance,” said <a href=#>Prince.</a> “So he wanted to see if he could smooth out his appearance, to help with his security on his physical appearance.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prince-Jackson-Reveals-His-Father-Michael-Jackson-Was-Very-Insecure-About-His-Skin-Condition-312.jpg><p>Michael was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1983. The 13-time Grammy winner used fair-colored makeup and creams to cover the blotches, causing a very pale appearance.</p><p>Michael first addressed the condition in a 1993 <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a>.</p><p>“I have a skin disorder, the pigmentation of my skin. <a href=# rel=noopener>It is something I cannot help</a>,” the singer said at the time.&nbsp; “When people make up stories that I don’t want to be who I am, it hurts me. It’s a problem for me. I can’t control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are? Nobody says nothing about that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added at the time: “It’s in my family, I can’t control it. It makes me very sad,” Michael added, denying that he was bleaching his skin. “I try to control it, and using makeup evens it out because I have blotches on my skin and I have to even it out. But you know what’s funny? Why is that so important? That’s not important to me.”</p><p>Michael died in 2009 of cardiac arrest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5yZqapKufo3q0rdisZKahk52upriMo5ico6Oku27DwKxkoqajmrC2vsRmmJunpal6qbXSZqqkoZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
