JUST…. W🌞W,” the Knives Out star wrote.</p><p>Words failed many of the commenters. <a href=#>Law & Order SVU</a> star <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a>, <a href=#>The View</a>‘s <a href=#><strong>Meghan McCain</strong></a> and Ready or Not actress <a href=#><strong>Andie MacDowell</strong></a> commented with flame emojis. Real Housewife <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> used stars while <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a> matched Stone’s bikini with yellow hearts. Designer <a href=#><strong>Vera Wang</strong></a> and drummer <a href=#><strong>Sheila E.</strong></a> went with the classic clapping emojis.</p><p>When she isn’t posing for the camera, Stone is raising three sons — Roan, 21, Laird, 16, and Quinn, 15 — as a single parent. “Every age when you’re a single mom is intriguing,” the actress <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly </a>in 2019. “[It’s] extra intriguing when there’s no dad.”</p><p>The Beauty of Living Twice author added that their busy summers help her get a little more time to herself. “Thank God the two young ones are at camp right now,” she added at the time. “I’ve had, like, two weeks of silence. The older one is working … and it’s just like, every summer when they do this, I feel like I remember me. I was cute. I was a girl. Oh yes, I’m back!”</p><p>When she isn’t busy working on her bikini body, Stone<a href=#> is swiping on Bumble</a>. The famous actress was accused of being a fraud after users on the dating app recognized her in late 2019. She had to take to Twitter to get the company to unblock her account.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Is being me exclusionary ? 🤷🏼‍♀‍ Don’t shut me out of the hive 🐝,” she tweeted. Her account was quickly restored.</p><p>Stone was married twice, first to producer <strong>Michael Greenburg</strong> from 1984 to 1990 and then to newspaper editor <strong>Phil Bronstein</strong> from 1998 to 2004.
