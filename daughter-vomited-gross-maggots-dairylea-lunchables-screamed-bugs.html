Rachel Stone, 39, and husband John, 44, bought their daughter Poppie, 7, her favourite snack from Iceland as a treat.
But the schoolgirl, from Rhuddlan, North Wales, was left screaming after discovering “worms” in the ham and cheese Dairylea graze box.
The family had been enjoying a BBQ when Poppie suddenly stated throwing up after eating some of the snack."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's disgusting.</p><p>"I was nearly sick myself but I was more concerned about her because she was in hysterics so I was trying to calm her down.</p><p>"She couldn't stop herself, she was sick on the spot.

She won't even eat ham sandwiches anymore.</p><p>"The manufacturer hasn't taken responsibility for it basically. They've said once it leaves their factory it's got nothing to do with them.</p><p>"They've said because of the size of the maggots and how long it takes to hatch eggs that it's Iceland's fault basically and that something's happened there.</p><p>"But Iceland are also not taking responsibility so I'm stuck in a rut with it at the minute. It's bad enough if that happened to an adult but especially to a child, it's not great on their behalf.</p><p>"People should be more aware that just because it's got a sell-by date on it and appears sealed doesn't mean it can't happen.</p><p>"You shouldn't have to check in all your packets of food to make sure there's nothing there but I would advise parents to as I certainly am now."</p><p>A spokesman for Mondelez International said: "We are very sorry to hear about Ms Stone’s unpleasant experience.</p><p>"We investigated the matter thoroughly, as we do with all complaints, and our extensive investigations have found no evidence that this has happened within our facilities, nor have we received any other complaints of this nature for this product.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"While we happily provided Ms Stone with a voucher as a goodwill gesture, we are confident that this damage did not occur at any of our sites."</p><p>A spokesman for Iceland declined to comment</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cbdf3bd6-54b9-4815-9ebb-7235a3fae7e2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000735963989.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV3hY9xZ25nlJbCqLTTnqlmrp%2BitrWxw2aeq6ejqHqurcagpq2rXZmuqr7YpZyaZZyqu6S0wJujnqtdqLCzscCmnJ1lkqq0tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
