He married Missy on February 3, 2007 in Philadelphia and it was shown on the MTV series Bam’s Unholy Union. Missy was an actress known for her roles in Mighags, Haggards, and The 69 Eyes: Dead Girls Are Easy, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2010 interview</a> with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a>, Bam revealed that he and Missy were living apart. “It’s strange because it’s better than ever in a weird way. I see her once a week…every time we meet up, we have a lot to talk about and it’s much more fun,” he said. Bam also claimed that Missy was aware he had girlfriends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bam and Missy got divorced in 2012. They didn’t have any children together. It’s been reported that their marriage fell apart because of Bam’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>battle with addiction.</a></p><h2>Nicole Boyd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bam-margera-wife-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Bam married his second wife in Reykjavik, Iceland, on October 5, 2013. They welcomed their son,&nbsp;<strong>Phoenix</strong>, four years after their wedding. The couple experienced ups and downs throughout their romance as Bam struggled with substance abuse. Some of the issues went public, like when Bam was arrested for a DUI in 2018 and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sent to rehab</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After nine years of marriage, Nicole <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for legal separation</a> from Bam in February 2023. She cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the split and listed Sept. 2021 as the date of their actual separation. Nicole asked for legal and physical custody of Phoenix and for spousal support, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Nicole got <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sole custody</a> of Phoenix in August 2023. Bam was limited to 20-minute FaceTime calls three days a week with his son in the ruling. It’s unclear if the former couple’s custody agreement has changed since then.</p><h2>Dannii Marie</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Bam and his fiancée were first romantically linked in July. They mostly kept their relationship out of the spotlight until Bam revealed to US Weekly&nbsp;that he proposed in October. Bam also shared that Dannii <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>helped him get sober</a> over the summer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I never had structure before. I always woke up not knowing what to do with the day … I would just look across the street, see an Irish pub and be like, ‘That looks like fun,’ ” he said in the December 20 interview. “Now I wake up, I walk the dogs, I stretch, I go to the gym, I go skateboarding. Everything’s a structured fun schedule. And we do it together, and it’s just a perfect thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GapGalkae0pr7AZq6inpVignN9knJubmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
