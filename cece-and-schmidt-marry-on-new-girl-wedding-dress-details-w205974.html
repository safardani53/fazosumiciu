As fans know, after a little too much bubbly, Cece (Hannah Simone) and Winston (Lamorne Morris) bought what the crew universally deemed an “ugly” wedding dress, covered with giant beads and mirrored panels.

At long last, Cece and Schmidt are getting married on <i>New Girl</i>‘s two-part finale, airing on Tuesday, May 10, and <i>Us Weekly</i> has all the scoop on what the bride will be wearing.</p><p><span>As fans know, after a little too much bubbly, Cece (</span><b>Hannah Simone</b><span>) and Winston (</span><b>Lamorne Morris</b><span>) bought what the crew universally deemed an “ugly” wedding dress, covered with giant beads and mirrored panels. (To quote Winston: “You look like a prostitute for wizards!”) But Jess (</span><b>Zooey Deschanel</b><span>) turned the dress inside out and promised she could turn it into something special.</span></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Celebrity Wedding Dresses: TV & Movies!</a></p><p>Fast-forward three months, and we have Cece’s ultimate wedding dress: a white stunner covered in gold lace. “We were locked into the silhouette of the ‘ugly’ dress,” costume designer <b>Debra McGuire</b> tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. “The challenge was matching the silhouette of the original dress with a new dress, because it could never be the same dress [with all those embellishments].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/new-girl-ed6116e2-5b7a-496f-bb7b-49e0b0ed6bdf.jpg><p>Then came Jess’ promised reimagining. While traditional Indian&nbsp;wedding dresses are red, Cece had been there and worn that for her first marriage in season 2, so McGuire decided to go in a different direction. She draped gold lace over the white dress and added a train, too.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: The Most Amazing Royal Wedding Dresses</a></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“We used red&nbsp;as the bridesmaid&nbsp;color instead,” she explains. “We also used red in the boys’ ties and in the beading on Cece’s veil. While the basic dress was cheap, the ‘inside out’ dress — and the multiples we needed to create — were quite expensive, with the labor and materials alone. It was a circuitous journey, but we got there!”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/new-girl1-8ac63a03-1d7e-4abb-bd9d-16eac1a7e7f3.jpg><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Celebrity Engagement Rings by Carat Size</a></p><p>Simone agreed that crafting the perfect dress for Cece was no easy feat. “You do put it on and say, ‘Oh, that’s it! That’s Cece’s wedding dress.’ So that was really cool to feel that,” the actress tells <i>Us</i>. That said,&nbsp;“I remember the way the dress initially looked and it was like, ‘Hard no! That’s not going to work.’ And Debra knew it wasn’t right, and [showrunner <b>Liz Meriwether</b>] knew it, too. But you have to start somewhere and we all contributed our ideas. It’s a bunch of women working on our show, so we always have ideas!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tune into the <i>New Girl </i>finale on FOX on Tuesday, May 10, at 8 and 9 p.m. EST.</p><p><i>Are you excited to see Cece and Schmidt get married at long last?
