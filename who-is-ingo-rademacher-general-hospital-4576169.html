The 50-year-old German-Australian actor has been met with backlash after <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reposting a tweet</a> on Nov. 7 that featured an image of U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health <strong>Rachel Levine</strong>, who is transgender. The tweet referred to Rachel as a “dude,” and so, Ingo was called “transphobic” for sharing the message by many, including General Hospital trans&nbsp;actress <strong>Cassandra James</strong>. Ingo later apologized in an Instagram video and said he “should’ve just crossed out” the word dude in the tweet. He also apologized directly to Cassandra: “I think you’re an absolute talent and you’re very beautiful as well. I don’t think a transphobic man would say that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Amidst the transphobia controversy, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reports came out</a> that Ingo had actually exited the daytime soap opera some time ago due to his protests against a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Ingo has made his anti-vaccine stance known on his social media pages. Below, learn more about Ingo Rademacher.</p><h2><strong>1.
