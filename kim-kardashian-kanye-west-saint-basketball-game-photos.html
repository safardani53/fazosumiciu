The rapper is apparently working with Beverly Hills attorney <strong>Nick Salick</strong>, after his&nbsp;New York lawyers<strong> Bob Cohen</strong> and <strong>Bernard Clair</strong> parted ways with him after he posted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>anti-Semitic comments</a>, which got him restricted/banned on some social media apps. Kim’s lawyer is<strong> Laura Wasser</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In addition to the custody and property settlement, Kanye has been facing backlash from his anti-Semitic comments, which has included him being <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dropped by Adidas</a> and other companies he had contracts with, knocking him off the billionaire list. “Adidas does not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech. Ye’s recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness,” Adidas, who worked with Kanye for nine years, said in a statement last week.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Adidas’ partnership with Ye accounted for $1.5 billion of his net worth, according to Forbes. “The $1.5 billion value of the Adidas deal was calculated off of a multiple of annual earnings. Based on interviews with industry experts, Forbes had viewed the royalties Ye received from Adidas to be similar to royalties from music catalogs or film residuals,” the outlet reported. Kanye’s new net worth is now reportedly $400 million and comes from “real estate, cash, his music catalog, and a 5% stake in ex-wife&nbsp;Kim<strong>‘</strong>s shapewear firm, SKIMS.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FyZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqytzbKcZq%2BVqMFuv8Cipa1lkpbArLHTm5ilpF2crq6xjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
