Not just that, he also has children he shares with his wife.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a full disclosure tweet from July 19, 2021, Mystal let his fans know that his children had picked up a British accent. He also disclosed that it was very likely that they picked it up from his wife, but he was happy to let the children's cartoon,&nbsp;Peppa Pig, share the blame.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>The tweet made two things clear: his wife is British, and they have kids together.</p><h2>Elie Mystal Gets A Doggo</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The coveted journalist made another revelation on August 24, 2021, via another tweet. The tweet was to let his followers know that his wife was not at all okay with him getting a doggo in the house.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The tweet narrated an interaction between Mystal, his wife, and his dog. The anecdote began with Mystal petting and pampering the canine as his wife watched him. He was letting the pup lick his face because apparently, she was a very good girl.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The wife was less than happy with his actions and pointed out that the dog had just puked on the couch. Still, he was adamant that he would not give it away.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That feeling didn't last, though. In an update, the journalist described how the dog used a box and a chair to climb onto their dining table and went on to defecate there.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Does any staff want to take my dog for a few days?" he offered.&nbsp;</p><p>In another tweet in the same thread, he shared an adorable snap of the pup sleeping on the couch "exhausted by her crimes."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Elie Mystal's Tea Adventures</h2><p>The doggo wasn't the only one of Mystal's excursions that the wife disapproved of; there was also his borderline obsession with tea.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In a Twitter post from August 16, 2021, Mystal revealed that he had spent over a hundred dollars on tea and then went on to suggest that his wife shouldn't leave him home alone with the debit card.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>When his wife got back, she apparently freaked out over the amount of tea that her beau had acquired in the time she was gone. In a failed attempt to console her, he told her that he would make the hundred bucks back when his book publishes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Not surprisingly, she wasn't convinced. She snarked, "You keep using that phrase. I do not think it means what you think it means."</p><p>All in all, the journalist is yet to reveal the name of his British spouse, but thankfully he keeps his followers updated on how things are going at home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ2cnrJuudisq5qkXay2p7GNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
