I never thought I would have 2 baby daddies – but sometimes life throws us curve balls,” she wrote via Instagram in September 2020, <a href=#>reflecting on her single woman status</a>. “Instead of getting stuck in these ‘setbacks’ I choose to look at these challenges as opportunities to grow. So while some may judge me and throw around rumors about me, most of you support me. And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing. … We are all a work in progress.”</p><p>The former spouses were married for nearly two years when they called it quits.
