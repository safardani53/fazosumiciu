From her bedroom, Marsai told her followers, “A lot of people have been addressing my hair and talking about my hair, and how it looks like a ‘grandma’s wig.’ And they’re talking about my veneers,” she said, pulling her invisible braces off her teeth — which are real, she noted. “I’m sorry to anyone I’ve offended or haven’t gotten to your expectations about how I’m supposed to be.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Little actress and producer pretended to choke up, and fought through tears. “I apologize. I never want to hurt anyone’s feelings or have anyone worry about what my decisions are,” she said, stopping to catch her breath. And blow her nose into a $100 bill. “Ya’ll we’re in quarantine, and we’ve got more things to focus on than just my hair. Justice for Breonna Taylor,” Marsai said before turning off the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/marsai-martin-blackish-bet-awards-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Listening, haters? Marsai just proved she doesn’t care and called you broke. She got major praise on Instagram for her video. Glee‘s <strong>Amber Riley</strong> commented, “Period sis” with the laughing and crying emoji. Her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black-ish</a> sister, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Yara Shahidi</strong></a>, dropped a ton of the laughing and crying emojis in the comments, too, as did <strong>Keshia Knight Pulliam</strong>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sorry some of y’all don’t like my hair.

She tweeted, “Sorry some of y’all don’t like my hair. Or teeth… which are my actual teeth btw. Good thing I don’t put my effort into trying to please everyone. I like it.
