And consider that the bulk of the filming seemed to have taken place in hotter-than-heck July and August, with Maria noting the project wrapped on August 5, 2022 on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p><p>Brian talked to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AfterBuzz TV</a> about wanting to create a magical holiday feel for the movie despite the high temperatures outside. “Whether the snow is real or fake, it doesn’t matter.

Pulling it off is entirely thanks to our crew.” Maria made it clear on social media that indeed, the crew became almost like family over the course of shooting in Georgia, saying in one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, "It takes a village!
