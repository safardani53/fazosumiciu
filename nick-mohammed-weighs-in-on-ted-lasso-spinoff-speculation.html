Nick Mohammed weighed in on whether Ted Lasso fans can expect a spinoff in the future.
“I’ve heard all kinds of rumors,” the U.K. native, 42, exclusively told Us Weekly on Tuesday, June 13, noting that he was as “surprised” as anyone when the official Apple TV Twitter account seemingly hinted at a new installment starring himself, Brendan Hunt and Brett Goldstein.
“Smells like potential,” the account tweeted earlier this month alongside a photo of the three actors as their respective characters: Nate, Coach Beard and Roy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We only conceived these three [seasons], then this thing became <a href=#>this big old thing</a>.”</p><p>Mohammed, for his part, echoed Sudeikis’ sentiments while still keeping hope alive for a spinoff of some kind. “The writers were always so clear that they had a three-story arc in mind for these three seasons of Ted Lasso and that story is complete,” the comedian told Us. “There are clearly <a href=#>setups for things</a> that could continue in that finale episode, undoubtedly. And so, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a break and things continue in some degree, whether it’s a film [or] whether it’s a new show with a different title with certain characters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nick-Mohammed-Weighs-in-on-Ted-Lasso-Spinoff-Speculation-01.jpg><p>As for how his character is doing after the events of season 3, Mohammed thinks Nate is “in a good place at the moment.”</p><p>He continued: “Nate’s story is such a test of our capacity for forgiveness. … We can very quickly judge and make snap decisions when we see behavior that we don’t condone, but we are far less willing to kind of engage with how this person got to that point and to then forgive them. That’s what season 3 does in terms of Nate.”</p><p>While Ted Lasso‘s future remains up in the air, the Emmy nominee has kept busy with his latest project, the black comedy Maggie Moore(s). Mohammed admitted that he <a href=#>felt “starstruck</a> for the whole six, seven weeks” of filming with costars <a href=#><strong>Jon Hamm</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tina Fey</strong> </a>and director <a href=#><strong>John Slattery</strong></a>.</p><p>The Job Lot alum recalled a brunch meeting with Slattery, 60, to “go through the script,” when Ted Lasso fans came up to ask for pictures with him. “They were just making John Slattery take all these photos of me. And I was like, ‘You do know that that is John Slattery? I mean, he is literally way more famous than I [am],'” he quipped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Maggie Moore(s) hits theaters on Friday, June 16.</p><p>With reporting by Leanne Aciz Stanton</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5tiurC0wKaknpxdrLKqs8esZKKmXaS7bsDEnWSlmaOovG6%2Fz6KlqJ6WYsCxscKuo5qsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
