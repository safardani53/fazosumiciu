Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox 5 Atlanta</a>, the series — which comes from creator Melissa London Hilfers — was actually filmed in North Georgia. More specifically, Monarch was filmed in Atlanta, Gainesville, and Macon. (Georgia has been called "the Hollywood of the South," partially due to its attractive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Film Tax Incentive</a>.)</p><p>The Georgia Department of Economic Development relayed that the show "hired 1,320 Georgia residents, paid out more than $41 million in crew paychecks, and spent more than $2.5 million on construction."</p><p>However, the Roman family estate — aka "The Brambles" — was not the work of Hollywood magic, as it's a genuine estate located in Hall County. The property spans 446 acres and is located at 3509 Tanners Mill Circle in Gainesville, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gainesville Times</a>. The gargantuan stone mansion sold for $15.5 million in August 2021.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Monarch on FOX (@monarchonfox)</a></p></figure><p style=text-align:start>“Massive patios wrap around the house to enjoy views of the exceptionally maintained property.
