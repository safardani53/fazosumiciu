They were just happy to have the band back together - which made the moment they released a new track even more special for those who have been with them since the very beginning.</p><p>Previously, frontman Gerard Way stated that the final song from the band was the 2014 hit Fake Your Own Death.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, Way explained, “I consider 'Fake Your Death' to be the last MCR song, and to me, it is absolutely the final fully realized collaboration between the members of the band.</p><p>"What was not so obvious at the time was that the song was, and would serve as, a eulogy for the band, though I should have known it from the lyrics. I think internally I did, as I felt an odd sense of sadness and loss after hearing back the words on top of the music.”</p><p>The song was a part of their album May&nbsp;Death&nbsp;Never Stop You, which was released on March 25, 2014, just days after they had announced that they were breaking up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000717587023.jpg><p>“I also felt a strange sense of pride in how honest it was, and could not remember a band recording a song of this nature, being so self-aware," Way continued.</p><p>"Ending felt like something honest, and honest always feels like something new. So it will exist, and it is no cowardly act to release something of this nature, but a service to those who believed in a band that did not compromise, and a wave goodbye to all. And yes, it is f***ing heartbreaking.”</p><p>At this time, it is unclear if the new track will lead to more or if this will just be a one-time thing for the band members ahead of their tour.</p><h2>When is MCR going on tour?</h2><p>MCR announced <a href=#>their tour</a> in 2020, but due to the <a href=#>Covid-19 pandemic</a>, they were forced to reschedule.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>The band will now <a href=#>hit the road starting on May 16, 2022</a>, and will play shows around the world through the end of the year.</p><p>They also have a few shows lined up for 2023 in <a href=#>New Zealand</a> and <a href=#>Australia</a>.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htY2h%2BdoSQaKSyZZOdsq61wpqjZqqfoq6vr8RmmZqmlGK6prnBnqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
