She cares too much about appearances."</p><p>Another theorized: "No way would they break up, most likely was away for another commitment like a business trip or Kyle deliberately didn’t post him to avoid dealing with comments."</p><p>A third commented: "Even if they separated, he’d definitely be there. This is all a storyline setup."</p><p>A fourth defended the doting dad: "I feel like people on here take social media so seriously.. just because he’s not posted in a few stories doesn’t mean they are having problems? What if he’s on a business trip?"</p><p>But a fifth suggested the pair might have "separate parties" for their daughter if their marriage was on the rocks.</p><p>This isn't the first time Kyle and Mauricio's relationship status has been in question.</p><h2>SPLIT RUMORS</h2><p>Last month, the couple sparked rumors that they called it quits after fans noticed Kyle <a href=#>ditched her wedding ring</a> during an outing.</p><p>Photos obtained exclusively by The U.S. Sun showed the 54-year-old picking up food in Studio City, California.</p><p>She donned workout clothes, suggesting that she either had been at the gym or intended to go.</p><p>The <a href=#>Bravo</a> star held her phone and a bag of food in her hands but clearly was missing her wedding band.</p><p>Speculation about Kyle and Mauricio's marital status has been rampant among fans for some time.</p><p>They have addressed the rumors in the past, maintaining that there is little to no truth to reports that their marriage is in trouble.</p><p>In October 2022, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;star addressed rumors that she had split from her husband and was seeing someone new.</p><p>The buzz came after she posted a photo of herself and E! News host Justin Sylvester sitting together, looking lovingly at one another.</p><p>The TV star captioned the post: "For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.... #BFFS."</p><p>Fans took the post literally and were convinced the pair were a couple.</p><p>She took to her Instagram Story in 2022, writing: "Gotta love the internet, attaching an Instagram Story from an article that read in part: "Fans wonder if Kyle Richards has a new husband after star shares sweet pic with BFF Justin Sylvester."</p><p>The drama came after Mauricio opened up about his marriage to Kyle on the Side Piece With Melissa Pfeister podcast, saying: "[I] let her talk, let her vent, let her talk about it, listen.</p><p>"You know, that's one of the most important things is to actually listen. I think her biggest frustration is when I am tuned out, and she wants to talk about it, and I have my mind on business and other stuff...That's hard."</p><p>He went on to suggest that things like that often lead to divorce, adding: "They get to see themselves on television, and they get to see the relationship of what it is themselves, and a lot of people have a perception of their own relationship being different than what it is, and then they see it because they watch it and then that causes the divorce."</p><h2>CHEATING ACCUSATIONS</h2><p>There have been several rumors about divorce and infidelity, but perhaps one of the most shocking ones suggested that Kyle's husband had cheated on her with her co-star Dorit Kemsley.</p><p>Dorit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded to the rumors</a>&nbsp;in 2022 after ex-RHOBH star Dana Wilkey shared a fan mock-up that showed Mauricio and Dorit cuddled close.</p><p>Dorit denied the cheating rumors and defended herself: "Kyle and Mau are our friends and my kids call them uncle and auntie.&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you think this is okay for my kids to see when it's a disgusting lie?"</p><p>She continued: "If this is the only way you can make a buck, then so be it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"But at least have some decency and stop trying to peddle false narratives, especially when you know there is zero truth behind it and your whole motive is to just hurt people for no read."</p><p>Dorit concluded: "It's sad, pathetic, and bound to bite you in the a$$ inevitably."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/actress-television-personality-kyle-richards-755137865.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/NINTCHDBPICT000733418055.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/2022-peoples-choice-awards-held-797986606.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWmFeX2UaKmhp5KdeqzFy55kq6GTna6zsNJmqqmkmal6qcHSm5innF2irra%2ByJygqGWloq6vv8qyZKutnaS%2FtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
