The program, which will launch on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, will be presented by actress and writer Michelle Buteau and will have nine competitors participating in a catfishing game. In a world where social media permeates practically every aspect of our lives, The Circle seems to be a natural match and an excellent Netflix binge-watch choice.</p><p>The contestants in the online networking competition show will be set up separately in their apartments and will talk to each other without coming face-to-face to catfish each other until one of them wins $100,000.</p><p>According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“In this social experiment and competitive program, online gamers flirt, befriend, and catfish their way to a $100,000 prize.”</p><h2>Josh Brubaker is a contestant on The Circle.</h2><p>Josh Brubaker was born in Michigan and now lives in Los Angeles, California. The celebrity wears many hats, including that of a prominent LA-based TikTok star and a radio DJ for ‘106.5 The End.’ He will be one of the participants who will join the program dressed as a catfish as a deceptive member.</p><p>Although The Circle star has been exceedingly discreet about his parents and family, one of his most popular TikTok videos features his niece.&nbsp;Josh ‘Bru’ Brubaker is known to New Country 93.1 listeners as Josh ‘Bru’ Brubaker, but the star has amassed a massive 4.1 million followers on TikTok, where he is known as the ‘CEO of Radio Tik Tok.’</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Josh-Brubaker-3.jpg alt="Josh Brubaker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>What started as a hypothetical ambition for him turned into a reality after one of his videos on the site, a film of him playing the incorrect music while on-air, received roughly 30 million views. He continued his interest in broadcasting by enrolling at the Specs Howard School of Media Arts. Josh hoped to work in television or athletics after discovering this institution at a college fair. He told WDIV-TV, a Detroit-based local television station,:</p><p>“I had no clue I wanted to be connected with radio; I love people and music and how they interact, so I kind of stumbled into it.”</p><h2>Broadcasting career</h2><p>Several years into his broadcasting career, he presented the afternoon program for New Country 93.1, co-hosted the Broadway in the Morning segment, and on weekends, he hosted the 96.3 WDVD channel. The TikToker is dating Anna Sitar, a fellow social media sensation and content developer. They announced their romance on social media in December of last year. Anna, who was designated one of TikTok’s breakout stars in 2021, made a video about courting her “online love,” causing followers to speculate about a potential relationship between the two. According to their accounts, the pair seems to be still going strong.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Josh-Brubaker-2.jpg alt="Josh Brubaker" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Josh also hosted the premiere of Spiderman: No Way Home and was spotted chatting with the film’s stars, Tom Holland and Zendaya, with the former grabbing his mike. His girlfriend Anna was also there at the occasion and uploaded a photo of the two together at the premiere.&nbsp;The Circle has remained one of Netflix’s most popular reality programs, and this trend is expected to continue in its third season.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqKuYYq%2BzwcGaop6qXaS7pnnOn2StoJVisLC6056qrZmeqcBustGopGasmJp6pLXRnKOeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
