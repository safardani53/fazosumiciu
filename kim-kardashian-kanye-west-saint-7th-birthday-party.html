In addition, it was recently revealed in a&nbsp;report by <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;that he&nbsp;allegedly “showed an intimate photograph” of Kim “in job interviews” during his now cancelled Yeezy partnership with Adidas. Kim has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>denounced Kanye’s hateful comments</a> but part of their recently finalized <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce&nbsp;settlement</a> specifies that Kanye can&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attend the children’s birthdays</a> if they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>come to an agreement</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Although Kanye was nowhere to be found when Kim took Saint and his friends to&nbsp;a Los Angeles Rams game for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lavish birthday party</a> on Sunday, December 4, he had his time with the now seven-year-old on his actual birthday. &nbsp;“Kim agreed to equal access to the kids on their birthdays and this was the first time that this was actually put to the test,” a source close to the reality star explained. “She did what she is obligated to do and she opened up her home to him so that Saint could spend time with his daddy. She chose to try and make it as easy as possible by opening up her home to him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kim-kanye-saint-birthday-spl-2embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SKIMS founder</a>&nbsp;celebrated her son’s special milestone with a special tribute to him on her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>&nbsp;page.&nbsp; “Happy 7th Birthday to my baby boy,” she wrote alongside a snap of her arms wrapped around her second child as he held a football. “I love you so so so much! I love seeing you grow into the kindest soul ever. Mommy loves you forever and ever!” Kim rocked her new&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>honey blond hair color</a> along with sunglasses in the photo, while Saint wore sweats and a Rams jersey. She also shared&nbsp;a series of throwback photos and videos on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story. “My chunk is so big now,” she wrote. “I wish he would wear his hair out of braids and twists sometimes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49wZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqytzbKcZq%2BVqMFuv8Cipa1lZ6m1bq7Iq6uhnJGuerGt0a2waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
