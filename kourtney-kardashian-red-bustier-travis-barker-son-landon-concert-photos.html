They couple took a vastly different approach to their wardrobe that evening, as they both dressed in epic black outfits, with Kourt sporting a skintight velvet dress. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BFFs</a> happened to be taking in the Canadian pop rocker’s show, as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Megan Fox</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</a><strong>Machine Gun Kelly </strong>were spotted in the audience as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, fans have been speculating about Kourtney and Travis’ plans to add a new member to their soon-to-be blended family. With the Poosh founder raising <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three of her own</a> little ones and the Blink-182 drummer co-parenting <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two teenagers</a>, the couple certainly know how to navigate a new bundle of joy. Amid all the speculation, a source EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> how Kourtney is feeling about having a baby with Travis.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“<span class=markxk9qawfpu data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kourtney</span> has been calling Travis her ‘future baby daddy’ before they even got engaged, so no one is surprised to learn that they are planning to have another child together,” the insider said. Part of planning their future together includes having a kid of their own, per the source. “They want to do this right after they wed but would not be shocked if this happened before they were wed. <span class=markxk9qawfpu data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Kourtney</span> wants the husband and newborn baby scenario, and she is going to have this.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>A new baby for Kourtney and Travis will no doubt be welcomed by the couple’s loving families. Kourt and ex <strong>Scott Disick’s </strong>brood — <strong>Mason</strong>, 12, <strong>Penelope</strong>, 9, and <strong>Reign</strong>, 7, — and Travis’s kids he shares with ex <strong>Shanna Moakler — Landon</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Alabama,</strong> 16<strong> —</strong> would make the best stepsiblings!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FwZqSnpafBr7HYZqKaqpSWwKm1wKdkq52UYq%2B2v9OinKtlpKeut7XSZpmaqpuav26%2FzqdkpZmembyvecKopZydoql6sbTOraasZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
