The detached home in Cross Hands, near Llanelli, was built in 1939 and has changed very little since that time - even the furniture is from that era.
It has remained in the same family since the keys were first handed over in 1939, but the current owners have reluctantly put the property, called Heol Bryngwili, on sale for £230,000 so they can downsize."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

first floor balcony.</p><p>Originally the house may have had a typical flat roof style but it has since been redone with a pitched roof.</p><p>An authentic glass-panelled front door leads to a hallway with its original woodwork and a built-in telephone and seating area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

interior doors.</p><p>Over the crittal windows in the front reception room are decorative window pelmets featuring a classic 'stepped' design.</p><img

a tiled fireplace topped with an arched alcove.</p><p>It was common in the 1930s for the front room to be the location for entertaining guests, known as the parlour, while the rear sitting room would have been a casual space for the family to relax.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

worktops.</p><p>The adjoining boiler room, side entrance hallway and pantry could all be incorporated to make a larger kitchen under the management of a new owner.</p><img
