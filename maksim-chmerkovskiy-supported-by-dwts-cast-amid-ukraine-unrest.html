Amid the Russian invasion of several Ukrainian cities, many of <a href=#><strong>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</strong></a>’s <i><a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>&nbsp;</i>friends and loved ones are <a href=#>sharing their support for the dancer</a>, who is still in Kyiv as the unrest continues.</p><p class=p1>“Everyone stop what you are doing and please please pray for my friend @maksimc and all those in danger RIGHT now in Ukraine,”&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>pro <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong></a> wrote via Instagram Story early on Sunday, February 27.</p><p class=p1>The Utah native, 28, also reshared one of Chmerkovskiy’s recent Instagram videos in which he described his experience.</p><p class=p1>“There’s air raid alarms everywhere,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Masked Dancer&nbsp;</i>alum</a>, 42, said in his Saturday, February 26, <a href=#>Instagram</a> video. “Literally right now. Constant. This is not, — there’s no drills. It’s nonstop about a minute, two-minute, three-minutes now and it’s all around Kyiv, and there’s constant videos of like the artillery shooting inside Kyiv. … Yo, pray for a lot of people.”</p><p class=p1>Several of <a href=#>Chmerkovskiy’s former dancing costars,</a> including Arnold, commented on his post to share their prayers.</p><p class=p1>“I love you and am praying for you&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>,” <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a> replied to his Instagram post before resharing it onto her Story.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Fuller House</a>&nbsp;</i>alum’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Peta Murgatroyd</strong></a>, also frequently asked her social media followers to join her in praying for his safe return.</p><p class=p1>“Today is extremely hard and the next few days will be even harder,” the Peta Jane founder, 35, <a href=#>wrote via Instagram on Thursday, February 24.</a> “Please play that he comes home soon. Please&nbsp;pray that he has a swift, safe exit. I have faith. I have hope and I have prayed so hard.”</p><p class=p1>Murgatroyd — who <a href=#>wed the Ukraine native in 2017</a> — has since shared several <a href=#>tributes to her spouse’s home country</a>, including one from her mother.</p><p class=p3>“My mums first and only post on Instagram. Lighting candles for my husband&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>,” the New Zealand native wrote via Instagram Story on Saturday, alongside a photo of a pair of lit candles next to a framed photo of Chmerkovskiy and Murgatroyd.</p><p class=p3>Chmerkovskiy — who was born in Odessa, Ukraine, before <a href=#>his family immigrated to the United States</a> in 1994 — had been living in Kyiv for the past six months while filming <i>World of Dance</i>. Amid <a href=#>the Russian invasion,</a> he’s given fans a look at his experience.</p><p class=p3>“Honestly, I’m getting really emotional. It’s been a little difficult. You know me, I stay strong. And I don’t show it, but I want to go back home,” Chmerkovskiy&nbsp;<a href=#>explained in a Thursday Instagram video</a>. “What I’m realizing is that my friends whose kids are here, whose moms, dads are here, and elderly people are here, they can’t just escape. I am not at this point someone who is pleading for someone else’s safety from a far distance, from a safe distance. I’m somebody who’s about to go into a bomb shelter because s–t’s going down.”</p><p class=p3>On Sunday, the Ukrainian-American dancer noted that he was exhausted when he took to an <a href=#>Instagram Live</a> video to share his feelings. “This is going to either escalate to human suffering on a crazy, historic level, or it’s going to stop right now,” he told followers.</p><p class=p6>Chmerkovskiy, who previously made headlines for <a href=#>confronting <strong>Kirstie Alley</strong> about misinformation</a>, gave a shoutout to the journalists on the ground in Kyiv.</p><p class=p6>“I give a lot of props to these reporters. I’m surrounded by news teams and what they’re doing is absolutely incredible,” he said. “They’re <a href=#>literally right on the front line</a>, giving you pictures of stuff. It’s an insane gig.”</p><p class=p6>However, the <i>DWTS </i>pro emphasized that<a href=#> what he really wants is peace and a way home</a>. “The reality is I just want to go home at this point. I’m just hoping for a safe ending to it all,” he said.</p><p class=p6>His wife, with whom Chmerkovskiy shares 5-year-old son <a href=#>Shai</a>, attempted to remind him of happier days ahead.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p9>“I love you. You w<a href=#>ill be home soon I promise</a>. Think about how many bbq’s we are [going] to have. Then the fishing trips with shai,” Murgatroyd commented on the video, adding a smiling face and heart emoji.</p><p class=p3>Scroll below to see how the&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>cast have shared their support:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqK30qKkZpuYorKzt86vqqShqWLAtrzPqKmtnZRir7p5w7CrrGWTlsC1ecCmoJ1lpaC%2ForXNnmSupqKawLV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
