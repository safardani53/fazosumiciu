He was 96.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tony Bennett, born Anthony Dominick Benedetto in Astoria, Queens on August 3, 1926, has passed away in his hometown of New York City at the age of 96 earlier today," his rep told PEOPLE in a statement. "The beloved singer, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 2016, is survived by his wife, Susan Benedetto, his two sons, Danny and Dae Bennett, his daughters Johanna Bennett and Antonia Bennett and 9 grandchildren."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The icon's family confirmed in January 2021 that Bennett had been quietly living with Alzheimer's disease since 2016. The revelation came as part of a profile on his life for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>AARP The Magazine</a>. When news broke of his health,&nbsp; Bennett was still capable of recognizing his friends and family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bennett's wife, who became his primary caregiver, told the magazine that he was "not always sure where he is or what is happening around him" and that "mundane objects as familiar as a fork or a set of house keys can be utterly mysterious to him."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Bennett and his wife, actress Sandra Grant Bennett.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Central Press/Hulton Archive/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His neurologist, Gayatri Devi, said that keeping up with his music has been incredibly beneficial for the Grammy Award winner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It kept him on his toes and also stimulated his brain in a significant way," Devi explained, later adding, "He is doing so many things, at 94, that many people without dementia cannot do. He really is the symbol of hope for someone with a cognitive disorder."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Benedetto, the singer was always in good spirits, even during his journey with Alzheimers. "But that's because he already didn't understand," she told&nbsp;AARP. "He would ask me, 'What is Alzheimer's?' I would explain, but he wouldn't get it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He'd tell me, 'Susan, I feel fine.' That's all he could process — that physically he felt great," Benedetto said. "So, nothing changed in his life. Anything that did change, he wasn't aware of."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Bennett performing at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Hot Pink Party: The Pink Standard at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on April 30, 2015 in New York.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur / Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bennett was a master jazz vocalist whose unique style and devotion to the classic American songbook carried him through eight decades of fame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He released his debut single “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Because of You</a>” in 1951 and dropped one of his most popular hits, “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>I Left My Heart in San Francisco</a>,” in 1962. Over the course of his iconic career, Bennett amassed 20 Grammy awards including the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001 — he gained recognition in the Grammy Hall of Fame for “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” in 1994.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the late star won two Emmy awards. In 2017, Bennett was honored with The Library Of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, making him the first “interpretive singer” to win the honor.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Bennett.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Noam Galai/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Among his countless accolades, the “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>My Favorite Things</a>” singer also won the GLAAD Media Award for outstanding music album in 2003.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE caught up with the star</a> in celebration of his 90th birthday in 2016. “I’m still wide awake!” the iconic artist said at the time. “My doctor likes to kick me out of his office and say, ‘There’s nothing wrong with you — don’t bother me!’ I’m very fortunate.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had a wonderful time growing up in Queens and dreaming about coming to the big city to make it,” Bennett told PEOPLE. “It all happened [in 1962] with my song ‘I Left My Heart in San Francisco.'”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Bennett.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by JP Yim / Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even in his late 80s, Bennett never gave up his dream. He won the Grammy award for best traditional pop vocal album two consecutive years in a row in 2015 and 2016. His second collection of Duets debuted at the top of the charts in September 2011, making Bennett the oldest performer in history to release a No. 1 album.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think being my age, staying in top shape is a first. Usually people are still respected if they show up at 90, but they say, ‘He’s not like he used to be’ and all that. And it’s not happening with me,” Bennett said. “I still have a lot of energy when I hit the stage and I feel blessed about the fact that I’m still going strong. We were always sold out wherever we played throughout my whole career, and it’s a blessing to still have that happen at 90.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As much as Bennett maintained his young spirit, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the star was required to slow down a bit in September 2019</a> when he contracted a virus and was advised to cancel a slew of upcoming performances in order to recover.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, Bennett always kept an active presence amongst his fans across all age groups, even posting on his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Facebook</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Instagram</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Myspace</a> accounts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Dear Lady – I always knew you could do anything at the highest level of artistry,” Bennet shared on Twitter <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrating Lady Gaga</a> for her 2019 Oscar nods. He was 92 at the time. “Congratulations on your Oscar nominations!
