On Wednesday, Russell Brand fielded one outrageous question after another about his failed marriage to Katy Perry during an interview with Howard Stern on his Sirius XM radio show.
In particular, Stern asked the 37-year-old British comic if &#34;sex wasn't freaky enough&#34; with Perry, 28, to whom he was married for just 14 months.
&#34;She was very willing to do wheelchair porn,&#34; Brand joked of the singer. &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"That woman spent ninety percent of our marriage in a little electric wheel chair."</p><p>These days, however, Brand told Stern, "I don't want porn anymore . . .There is no market for it in my life. I've got no kind of weird predilections especially."</p><p>VIDEO: Katy's hottest hairstyle of all time?</p><p>Confirming his new relationship with <strong>Isabella Brewster</strong> (sister to Dallas star <strong>Jordana Brewster</strong>), Brand mused with Stern about his dating and sex life as a single, newly-divorce man.</p><p>"[I had] a little bit of a reaction," Brand admitted, offering a very elaborate metaphor. "Like if you've been on a diet of rice for awhile and then suddenly Willy Wonka said, 'I need you to run my chocolate factory.'" He joked. "I think, for awhile, you'd be kicking over barrels of candy and swimming about in the chocolate river. That's not a euphemism!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Rock of Ages star also denied speculation that he didn't get along with Perry's parents, who are Christian evangelicals.</p><p>"No, they were lovely," Brand said. "We had a really great relationship actually. When you say that they are Christians, Howard, they are not. . stiff . . Her dad came from sort of a crazy background, and her mom went to Berkley in like the sixties. They were more born again Christians, so I think they kind of identified with me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarraOosq24jJupmqaUYrewt8SsZJqan6rBbr%2FEsWSloZaaeqKy056pZqORqcZuvMSrqbJlYmV%2Bc32YcGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
