Ruberton and Robert R. Simons describe the results of their own investigation into circumstances leading up to the stabbing, including fresh allegations of harassment and intimidation by Latham and others."</p><p>After the initial "Karen" TikTok, Latham promised to reveal the home address of the Durhams if he got 1 million views on subsequent TikToks. Yet another video features William Durham, Catherine Durham's son, walking up to Latham's car and asking him to get out. Latham claimed he had a knife.

Is he going to jail?</h2><p>Latham's wife, Sarah Latham, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded the stabbing of William T. Durham</a> on May 4, 2020. The video begins with William and Gage Durham, the sons, riding their bikes up to the Latham property followed quickly by William T. Durham in his truck. "I promise you, you better back up because you're not gonna like what's coming out," says Sarah from behind the camera.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Back up, back up," Sarah tells William, Gage, and William T. Durham who is quickly walking towards the Latham's garage. Sarah then calls for Latham who comes out. It's hard to tell in the video, but he's carrying a knife and a stun gun that can be heard going off. The younger Durhams back him into the garage as Latham swings his arm around. Both Sarah and her husband yell, "Get off our property."</p><p>The three Durham family members back Latham into the garage as Sarah keeps yelling, "Babe!" The camera gets shaky, but one of the last clear images is of William T. Durham covered in blood walking out of the garage.</p><p>Latham was "charged with second-degree reckless manslaughter, aggravated assault, and weapons offenses," reported NJ.com. His trial began March 30, 2023, and as of the time of this writing, the trial is ongoing.
