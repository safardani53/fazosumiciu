The family was known as the “Von Platt family singers,” he added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who are Ben Platt’s parents?

While the sisters have kept their lives largely out of the spotlight, all three of the brothers are fairly public-facing, given that the three of them perform together as a band, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Platt Brothers</a>, singing primarily Hebrew songs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Jonah and Henry graduated from their parents’ alma mater, where Henry became <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>an advocate for mental health</a>. Much like Ben, the two of them have also pursued careers in the arts: Jonah starred as Fiyero in Wicked, while Ben has gained social media fame for his musical talents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite their busy careers, Marc and Julie always knew that raising children would be their priority. “Both of us frankly, more than anything, just wanted to be parents,” the proud mom told The Pennsylvania Gazette. “So it may sound like it’s something difficult, but it actually is the most pleasurable part of our lives.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marc echoed his wife’s sentiments in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jewish Journal</a>, telling the outlet, “There’s nothing like my family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, “It doesn’t mean I don’t try really hard to be a great producer, and it doesn’t mean I’m not competitive and don’t want to earn Oscar nominations.

A middle child, he grew up in a conservative Jewish household alongside his older brother Jeffrey and younger sister Wendy, according to Jewish Journal. He attended Pikesville High School, graduating in 1975, before going on to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.A. in Sociology and honed his musical talents at the school’s glee club. It’s also where he began directing plays in earnest, after years of helping put on high school productions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It sounds silly, I suppose, but a play is a play, whether it’s in your backyard or a high-school stage or in the Quad or on Broadway. When you’re learning in all those environments, it all adds up to helping one become a good storyteller,” he told The Pennsylvania Gazette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At school, he put on productions in the Quad as a freshman, and helped fix up a basement room into a nightclub-cabaret of sorts, where he’d help organize productions alongside a group of friends every week.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marc-is-an-award-winning-producer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Marc is an award-winning producer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Marc Platt attends the 20th Annual Hollywood Film Awards on November 6, 2016 in Beverly Hills, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>David Crotty/Patrick McMullan/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Early on in his career, Marc pivoted from acting to producing, realizing he felt more creatively stimulated by the work behind the scenes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I realized being a producer was a very exciting thing. It satisfied my creative needs, it let me be in control, and it allowed me to satisfy the business side that interested me,” he told The Pennsylvania Gazette. “Dealing with lots of people, and having a very large vision of something — I found that more satisfying than being an actor.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an effort to gain a leg up on the business side of things, he attended New York University School of Law after graduating from college, going on to work as an attorney in entertainment law for Sam Cohn, a top Hollywood agent at the time. He also interned for two years with famed Broadway producers Elizabeth McCann and Nelle Nugent, who “taught me the Broadway business,” he told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marc went on to land top positions at a number of distribution companies — first, as Vice President at RKO Pictures, and later as President of Orion Pictures and eventually, Universal Studios.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He founded his own production company, Marc Platt Productions, and has earned a slew of awards — one Golden Globe, two Tonys, two Primetime Emmys, and three Academy Award nominations among them. He has been a creative force behind a string of hit movies including Legally Blonde, Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry McGuire, La La Land and dozens more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But his true pride and joy is the mega-hit Wicked, which he brought to Broadway in 2003, and which has remained one of the top-grossing shows.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-julie-has-dedicated-her-career-to-fundraising-for-the-jewish-community></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Julie has dedicated her career to fundraising for the Jewish community</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ben Platt and his mom Julie Platt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ben Platt Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in 1957 in Wichita, Kansas, to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joan Schiff Beren</a>, a highly-regarded philanthropist to Jewish causes, Julie grew up as one of the only Jewish people in her community.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In my high school graduating class of 671 students, I was the only Jew,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jewish Journal</a>. “But I actually think that when you are from a small town, the necessity to stand up and be counted is even stronger,” she said. “I felt from the beginning that if we Jews didn’t look out for the Jewish community, there wasn’t anybody else to step up. It wasn’t out of a sense of peril; it was a feeling of ‘l’dor v’dor,’ that I was a link in the chain.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a stint as a banker following her graduation, Julie has held several prominent positions to help fundraise for Jewish causes and to support Penn alumni.

She’s also a Co-Chair of Penn Hillel's National Board of Governors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">More recently, Julie took on the role of chair of the Board of Trustees of the Jewish Federations of North America in 2022.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-theyre-philanthropists></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They’re philanthropists</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Julie Platt and Marc Platt attend the 89th Annual Academy Awards on February 26, 2017 in Hollywood, California.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The theater-loving couple have been longtime benefactors for the University of Pennsylvania, often giving back to the school that first brought them together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2005, they made a substantial donation in order to enhance the university’s performing arts capabilities, and The Platt Student Performing Arts House opened in September 2006, boasting 13,000 square feet of office and performance space.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Penn’s theater and music programs had a profound impact on our lives, not only in what we learned but also in the fun we had and the friendships we made,” Marc told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>University of Pennsylvania Almanac</a>. “So when this opportunity came up, Julie and I looked at each other and said, ‘We’ve enjoyed being benefactors to the University in other areas, but in terms of a very large gift, we couldn’t think of anything better than a student performing-arts center.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ben-came-out-to-them-at-age-12></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ben came out to them at age 12</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Noah Galvin and Ben Platt attend The 76th Annual Tony Awards on June 11, 2023 in New York City.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor’s coming out story didn’t exactly ruffle any feathers in the Platt household, he recalled in Ben Platt Live from Radio City Hall. During an eighth grade class trip to Israel, Ben felt moved to discuss his sexuality with his parents for the first time after a teacher worried he was being bullied about it and informed him she was going to call them himself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Instead, he called them from his hotel room in Tel Aviv, explaining he had something important to share.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And my mom goes, ‘Is this about your sexuality?’ I was like, ‘Let me finish!’ ” he said. “Basically, she said, ‘We know, you spent most of your childhood dressed as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, no one is surprised.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, that’s great.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He shared that he hopes everyone can have a coming-out story that’s “that much of a nothing,” adding, “Because it doesn’t need to be an event or an announcement.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-theyve-always-nurtured-bens-musical-talents></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>They’ve always nurtured Ben’s musical talents</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ben Platt and Julie Platt attend the 2017 Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 11, 2017 in New York City.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jenny Anderson/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A musical theater kid practically since birth, Ben began performing in early childhood, joining a national tour of Caroline, or Change at age 10. Long before he shot to stardom in 2015 while originating the title role in Broadway’s Dear Evan Hansen, his parents were proudly encouraging his love of performing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Most kids, when they’re young, want computer games and Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles,” Marc told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a> in 2016. “Ben always wanted a clip-on microphone, so he could perform in the backyard, and one year he wanted a fog machine.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ben echoed those memories in a separate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Times</a> interview, noting that in his youth — much like his father — he “spent a lot of time turning over furniture and trash cans and staging Cats in my backyard.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>concept of “Nepo-Babies”</a> — a.k.a. celebrities with famous parents — went viral, Ben had often opened up about the perks and pitfalls of making a name for himself in an industry where his father’s success follows him at every turn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’ve done as best a job as we can making it clear that I’m earning what I’m earning because of me, and not because of who my father is,” Ben told the Times. “But at the same time, I’m not ignoring things that would be dumb to ignore, like people that I can know through him, and experiences I can have through him, and things that I can learn from him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another Times interview, the actor added that it would be “totally disingenuous” to ignore the advantages that his father’s success has provided him. “But it’s also made me aware of how lucky I am, and how hard I have to work to prove I deserve these opportunities I’ve been given," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5GhuW6twaisrWWSmrtuvMuaq61loJa%2FprrTrGRxbGFlgXp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
