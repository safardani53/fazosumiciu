The&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules stars took to Instagram on Sept. 21, making the announcement to their fans and followers. “Mom & Dad. The love of our lives is coming soon,” Brittany wrote in an Instagram post, which included a photo of the Bravo star debuting her baby bump, which Jax cradled from behind! The expecting parents were also holding sonogram photos of the baby.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jax shared similar photos on his own Instagram page, and was excited to tell fans, “Sooooo,……..I am gonna be Dad..” Fans were ecstatic — including his&nbsp;Vanderpump Rules&nbsp;family, of course. “I AM SO HAPPPYYYY,” <strong>Kristen Doute</strong> gushed, while <strong>Beau Clark</strong> suggested that this has been top secret information for quite some time. “Yesssss. Finally. Holding in this secret has been hard!!!!! Let’s start a dad club with @randallemmettfilms,” wrote Beau, who’s expecting his first child with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a> (he was also referring to the fact that another&nbsp;VPR&nbsp;star, <strong>Lala Kent</strong>, is expecting a baby with <strong>Randall Emmett </strong>at the same time).</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The exciting news shouldn’t come as a total shock to fans, after Brittany sparked pregnancy rumors for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>covering her stomach</a> in a bikini photo in July of 2020 (however, it’s not confirmed if she was expecting at this time). Jax and Brittany also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed</a> that they were trying for a baby in the later half of 2019. “Yeah, we’re obviously open to it, we’re not like, well I guess yeah, we’re working on it,” Jax revealed EXCLUSIVELY to <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>in September of that year at he Carl’s Jr. Ultimate Avocado Brunch. “We’re working on it, I’ll leave it at that, we’re working on it.” Brittany also confirmed that they’re “in the process” of trying to have a baby during an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVE interview</a> with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in Dec. 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Even before those interviews, we learned that the couple was “excited to be actively trying for a baby now. They want to have kids right away and would like to be pregnant ASAP,” a source shared with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in July of 2019. “They both feel ready and would be ecstatic to take a pregnancy test that turns out to be positive. They both feel really ready for this. Brittany doesn’t think she’s pregnant right this second, but the way they aren’t not trying, anything could be possible.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>However, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>babymaking plans were stalled</a> when the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States hard in March of 2020. Jax was particularly worried about welcoming a newborn in the height of quarantine restrictions. “If [Brittany] gets pregnant, like what if we need to go to a hospital and we can’t…I think the worst. I’m so scared with the way the world is right now to go to the hospital,” Jax told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> on Watch What Happens Live: At Home&nbsp;in April of 2020. It looks like the parents are working around those fears, now!</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Brittany Cartwright sparked pregnancy speculation after hiding her stomach while wearing a bikini in this photo, shared in July of 2020. (Photo Courtesy of Instagram/@kristendoute)</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Jax and Brittany have really been living on cloud nine since their nuptials on June 29, 2019. The couple were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married in Kentucky</a> and had a “magical, fairy-tale themed ceremony in front of 240 guests.” Brittany was absolutely stunning in an off the shoulder white wedding gown with a fitted bodice that featured a full skirt, long train and veil. She wore her hair down and off to one side. The couple has really been so in love, and have stuck by each other through&nbsp;Vanderpump drama and low-key times. Now, a new chapter in their life is starting, as they prepare to welcome their first child together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e5FqZpuqmanBorrYZpqaqqSsv6qzx61kqaqVnLuiutNmmZqaqWK3osSMrZiypJ%2Bneqe10ayrZpuYnrmlew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
