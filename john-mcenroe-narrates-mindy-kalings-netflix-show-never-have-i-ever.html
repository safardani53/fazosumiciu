It's like an English Anglophile kind of thing," Kaling told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>USA Today</a>. "When we decided that the character of Devi would have a temper, the McEnroe thing just kept coming back: you know, someone who's high-achieving but is undermined by their own temper."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "He has really high standards for himself and everyone around him. We kept talking about him and were like, 'Wait, should he be doing the narration?' Devi's dad loved tennis, and it timed out that he would have grown up watching McEnroe."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Screengrab from Never Have I Ever Netflix show.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Never Have I Ever stars Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Devi, a first-generation Indian American teenage girl with a short fuse who has a way of getting herself into trouble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kaling, who serves as executive producer for the show, said she reached out to McEnroe about getting him to narrate Devi's adventures through young adulthood before she even had a script ready.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I went over to his art gallery and it was him and his wife," Kaling said. "We just had coffee; I didn't even have a script at that point. I just said, 'This is the vision,' and they were into it. I think his kids watched <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Office</a> and knew me from that, and [told their parents], 'She has a good pedigree' or something. So I was happy about that."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the 10th and final episode of Never Have I Ever, McEnroe transitions from his voiceover role to make a cameo, a decision Kaling said was made at the last minute.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was actually in Malibu with his wife and we were like, 'Hey, do you want to come do this?' And he was like, 'Yeah, no problem,'" Kaling recalled. "He just showed up in a wetsuit and it was awesome. We shot 15 minutes away from his house, so it was easy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: The 'Never Have I Ever' Cast Share Their Hopes for a Possible Season 2: 'Bring on the Drama!'</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">McEnroe, playing himself, runs into Devi, her mom and her cousin on the beach before they scatter her dad's ashes in the ocean. Devi shares that her dad, who loved tennis, is dead, to which the Grand Slam champion responds, "Yeah. A lot of my fans are now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to filming the scene with him, 18-year-old Ramakrishnan said she had no idea who McEnroe was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I definitely had to Google him up before that episode," Ramakrishnan said. "When I read the script for the first episode, me and a couple castmates had to figure out, 'Who is this narrator?' But it was really interesting to film with him. We casually talked to him. He seemed pretty chill."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKu7x6dkppuVo7%2BwsYynmKuqkamytHnMoqWdsV2grq21zaCqZqaVqbOttddmqqGnp2K7psLEq2Shmaaaeqp5xK%2Bcq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
