Kate Hudson rocked a thong bikini — and grossed out her older brother — while celebrating the start of summer.
“Suns out, buns (and huns) out ☺️☀️ #summerready,” the 44-year-old actress captioned a series of Instagram snaps on Tuesday, May 30.
The How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days star dared to bare skin as she enjoyed the California sunshine poolside over Memorial Day Weekend.

Hudson donned a giant straw sun hat, thong bottoms and nothing else as she joined her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Danny Fujikawa</strong></a>, in the water.</p><p>“Jesus no Kate!” the <a href=#>Something Borrowed</a> actress’ eldest brother, <a href=#><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a>, quipped in the comments section. (The “Sibling Revelry” podcast cohosts are the oldest children of <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a> and ex <strong>Bill Hudson</strong>. The Overboard actress, 77, also shares son <a href=#><strong>Wyatt Russell</strong></a> with <a href=#>longtime partner <strong>Kurt Russell</strong></a>. The Tombstone actor, for his part, also welcomed son <strong>Boston Russell</strong> with ex <strong>Season Hubley </strong>before he began dating Hawn in 1983.)</p><p>Several of the <a href=#>Almost Famous</a> star’s followers disagreed with Oliver’s assessment of the sexy snaps. “Kates living her best life and I’m here for it 🔥,” one user wrote in the comments section. Pal <strong>Jennifer Meyer</strong> responded: “Love that tush 😍.”</p><p>The King St. Vodka founder — who <a href=#>shares son Ryder, 19, with ex-husband <strong>Chris Robinson</strong></a>, son Bingham, 11, with ex-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Matthew Bellamy</strong></a> and daughter Rani, 4, with Fujikawa, 36 — is known for her tiny bikinis and carefree attitude toward nudity.</p><p>“To be honest, it doesn’t take a lot for me to take my clothes off. People can say whatever they want, but I like being naked. Always have,” Kate told <a href=#>InStyle</a> in August 2019, <a href=#>reflecting on her 2001 cover shoot</a> for the magazine. “I posed naked for the cover, and I was strategically draped with what was basically chain mail. The stylist had a very hard job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Kate-Hudson-Celebrates-Kick-Off-to-Summer-With-Cheeky-Thong-Bikini-Snap.-2.jpg><p>When it comes to going nude on screen, the Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery actress told <a href=#>The Sun</a> that she only has one problem with it — the press tours.</p><p>“I don’t have an issue with nudity personally — I think it’s great,” she told the outlet in December 2022. “But I don’t want to be on a promo tour and all anyone wants to talk about is my boobs, and how hard was that [to film]. You don’t want the movie to be about that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Truth Be Told alum isn’t the only member of her family <a href=#>who isn’t afraid to strip down on social media</a>. Oliver, 46, often posts pictures of his naked backside via Instagram, <a href=#>including a February snap</a> in which he was promoting his “Consciously Uncoupled” podcast.</p><p>At the time, he stood nude in the desert with just a pair of socks and running shoes. “It would mean a great deal to me and my family … especially @katehudson,” he captioned the picture. “Unrated version of this post in stories … thank you and enjoy the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6CutbGMoaydq5%2BjerO7wqSqZqyYpLuoecGioqKmmWLBsHnKopqkZZ%2Bbs26%2F1KaknqpdqLKiv86nZKmhk6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
