The show canceled the red carpet last minute and moved to a pre-taped format amid the Writers Guild of America planning to picket the event and host <a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> dropping out to show her support for the writers strike. (Barrymore will host the 2024 event.) Stars including Pedro Pascal, Ariana Madix and Jennifer Coolidge pre-taped acceptance speeches, but there was no speech aired from Pankow and Bailey.</p><p>Year after year, <a href=#>the Best Kiss award</a> is one of the most anticipated categories at the MTV Movie & TV Awards — and the 2023 nominees only added to the hype.</p><p><strong>Anna Torv</strong> and <strong>Philip Prajoux</strong> were up for The Last of Us while <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a> and <strong>David Dawson</strong> got a nod for My Policeman. From the small screen, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Outer Banks</a> stars were nominated, <a href=#><strong>Riley Keough</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sam Claflin</strong></a> for <a href=#>Daisy Jones & the Six</a> and <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong></a> for <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the awards show, more than one of the pairings <a href=#>caused a stir for their scene-stealing smooches</a>. Bailey and Pankow, both 24, turned heads on <a href=#>season 3 of Outer Banks</a> as their respective characters, Kiara and JJ, finally crossed the line from friends to lovers.</p><p>“I think … the end game of the OBX, I can see JJ and Kiara being like, ‘All right, there’s something here,’” Pankow <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in April 2020 <a href=#>ahead of the season 3 romance</a>.</p><p>Bailey, for her part, told <a href=#>Decider</a> in February that fans would “finally” see the characters “act on their chemistry that has been present since season 1,” noting that <a href=#>the kiss was “slightly overdue.”</a></p><p>Gomez and Delevingne, both 30, also received an outpouring of love from viewers <a href=#>after they locked lips</a> on season 2 of Only Murders in the Building.</p><p>“It was just fun,” Delevingne recalled of the onscreen moment during a June 2022 appearance on <a href=#>E!’s While You Were Streaming</a>. “Would anyone in the world not like to kiss Selena?”</p><p>The model added: “It was just hysterical. It’s just one of those things, especially when you know someone so well, it’s the comfortability and you kind of have fun with it.”</p><p>As in years past, fans <a href=#>tuned in to the MTV Movie & TV Awards</a> to see whether the actors who took home the Best Kiss popcorn trophy would steam up the stage during their acceptance speech.</p><p>In 2000, a roar erupted at the awards show when <a href=#><strong>Selma Blair</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></a> shared a peck on stage after winning for their <a href=#>over-the-top makeout session in Cruel Intentions</a>.</p><p>Five years later, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong></a> — who were then a real-life couple — shocked the audience with their steamy kiss. (The pair called it quits in 2007 after two years of dating.)</p><p>After winning the accolade for their work in <a href=#>The Notebook</a>, McAdams, now 44, famously ran across the stage and leapt up into Gosling’s arms to share a passionate kiss. The La La Land star, now 42, then proceeded to hold onto his then-girlfriend and wander off backstage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In more recent history, <a href=#><strong>Chase Stokes</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Madelyn Cline</strong></a> brought the heat when <a href=#>they accepted the 2021 award</a>.</p><p>Stokes, 30, was in the middle of thanking the Outer Banks creators when Cline, 25, told him to “shut up” and laid a big smooch on him. The duo, <a href=#>who dated from spring 2020 to fall 2021</a>, continued to make out for a few seconds as the crowd cheered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSanJmovK95wZqgpZ2pYq6vsIyrrJ2xXaWur7fOsGSwoZ5ir6a%2F02aioqujYq61ecytrWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
