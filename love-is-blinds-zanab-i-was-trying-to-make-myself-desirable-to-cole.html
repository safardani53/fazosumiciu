The things he was saying to me did hurt. I was somehow trying to make myself desirable to him, whether it be skinnier, or…” the 32-year-old flight attendant told <a href=#>Variety</a> on Wednesday, November 9, taking a breath and pausing before she continued speaking. “I’ve never had someone speak to me that way about my body or eating. That was very real for me. I did change what I was eating. I was just eating a banana. I did lose weight by the wedding day. It had nothing to do with fitting into my wedding dress.”</p><p>During Wednesday’s reunion,<a href=#> Zanab called it Cole’s “saving grace” that the Netflix series didn’t include all of their tense moments.</a> She then alleged that her then-fiancé pushed food away from her, tried to “control” what she ate and made “daily comments about [her] face and body [that] were not used.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Love-Is-Blind-Zanab-Jeffrey-Cole-Barnett-Conversations-About-Looks.jpg><p>When he denied her claims, she added: “And that’s great because it really did protect you and you are now denying it and calling me a liar in front of all these people.”</p><p>Following several references to the “cuties’ story,” the LIB reunion concluded with the previously unaired scene in which Cole reminded Zanab that they are having a “big ‘ole supper tonight” as she ate two clementines. During the scene, he also seemed confused when she said she hadn’t eaten anything but a banana all day, noting that he offered her a poke bowl.</p><p>While speaking to Variety, Zanab reacted to another moment that has made waves among viewers — Cole’s comment that he knew someone named Zanab wouldn’t look like his past girlfriends.</p><p>“Everyone heard it. Even watching it back, I was like, wow, I really didn’t hear that like everyone else heard it. I’ve gotten hundreds of messages like what you just said: ‘He’s saying this,’” she said, referring to the implication that Cole previously only dated white women. “In the heat of that moment, I didn’t necessarily hear it. But we’d had conversations about women he previously dated. There were many conversations about how I did not look like it or live up to it.”</p><p>She added that she’s <a href=#>“doing great” months after turning Cole down at the altar.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I did leave that relationship broken. I was devastated not to get married. I was sad that I had this great love and it didn’t result in a healthy relationship that turned into a happy marriage,” the reality star explained. “I recognized some stuff on myself that I was like, ‘Wow, I need to go build myself back up. I used to be a words of affirmation person. I need to do that. I need reassurance. I need to get back to myself and encourage myself.’ So that’s really what I’ve done for the last year. I did go to therapy after the wedding, because I was like, ‘When this comes out, I’m going to have to revisit this and I don’t want to be slingshotted back to how low I feel right now.’ I’ve been in therapy for a year, and I’ll probably continue going to therapy because I think therapy is wonderful.”</p><p>Zanab concluded: “I’ve just taken all that that relationship taught me and truly just been so selfish this year and poured into myself and loved myself hard and gave myself those affirmations because I never want to be in that low of a space in a relationship ever again. I just want to give my healthiest, happiest self to someone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYseiusCbZKJlp5bAbsDRsqCnn12pvG65wKScZqWpqLKtsoydnKyhopavrbGMraZmm5%2BhsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
