The actress and activist, 31, has made a name for herself since the debut of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. She has gone on to star in other notable film projects, including The Bling Ring, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Women. With a high-profile career comes high-profile relationships.

He told Heat&nbsp;in 2011 that he broke things off because he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wanted to achieve his “own notoriety,”</a> saying, “I have always been an ambitious person and I want to achieve my own notoriety for what I’ve done. That’s why I chose not to pursue it any longer, because I didn’t want to be the boyfriend of some child actress.” He called Emma a “really cool person.”</p><h2>Jay Barrymore</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Emma and Jay, an English financier, dated between 2008 and 2009. They reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split due to the long distance</a>: Emma attended college at Brown University in the States at the time, while Jay lived in the United Kingdom. “The transatlantic gap proved too much for their relationship to survive,” a source told Irish Examiner.</p><h2>Rafael Cebrián</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Emma and Rafael, a Spanish musician and actor, dated between late 2009 and 2010 after meeting at Brown.

The two were spotted <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kissing outside of restaurant</a> in Santa Monica in August of that year. “They have really fallen for one another and both aren’t dating anyone else,” a source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> at the time.</p><h2>Will Adamowicz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-6.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Emma and Will, a fellow student she met when she attended the University of Oxford in England, dated between late 2011 and 2013. They <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were first spotted kissing</a> at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012. The actress’ rep confirmed to multiple outlets in 2014 that they called it quits and were “no longer in touch.”</p><h2>Matthew Janney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-7.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Emma and Matthew, a fellow student at Oxford and rugby player, dated for nearly a year in 2014. In the September 2015 issue of British Vogue, Emma <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called the split “horrendous,”</a> revealing she went on a weeklong silent retreat to figure out how to be single. “I felt really uncomfortable,” she said. “Even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself.”</p><h2>Roberto Aguire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-8.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Emma and Roberto, an actor known for his roles in Pretty Little Liars and NCIS: New Orleans, were briefly linked in 2015.

In her March 2017 cover story for Vanity Fair, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emma explained why she wouldn’t</a> speak publicly about her boyfriend. “I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home,” she said. “You can’t have it both ways. I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”</p><h2>Chord Overstreet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-10.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Emma and Chord, an American actor best known for his role in Glee, briefly dated in 2018 for about six months.

The two <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were spotted kissing in Mexico.</a> The split came some time before late 2019: Emma covered the December 2019 issue of British Vogue and said <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she was “very happy” being single</a>. “I call it being self-partnered,” she said.</p><h2>Leo Robinton</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emma-Watson-Romantic-History-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Emma and Leo, a Los Angeles-based businessman, have been dating since fall 2019.
