In one sketch, Kim recreated her 2009 (and 2016) Princess Jasmine costume as she portrayed the Disney character alongside Pete’s Aladdin. While <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on a romantic red carpet ride</a>, Pete’s Aladdin expressed concern over his romance with Kim’s Jasmine — feeling that he might not be able to “handle” her in the bedroom. The pair shared a kiss at the end of the sketch, which went viral on social media for hours the next day!</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kim’s divorce from ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, 44, is on-going: the KKW Beauty founder filed in Feb. 2021 after seven years of marriage and four children together. She has, however, been supportive of Kanye through the release of album&nbsp;Donda&nbsp;and Kanye notably was in the audience during&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;(the pair were also seen leaving her hotel together). Notably, Pete is currently single <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>since his split</a> from&nbsp;Bridgerton‘s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Phoebe Dynevor</strong></a>, 26,&nbsp;last August. While the comedian has dated older women — like <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong> — in the past,&nbsp;TMZ&nbsp;reports that Kim and Pete are just friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The SKIMS founder&nbsp;isn’t the only one to have brushed elbows with Pete in the group lately. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, 45, made an unexpected appearance as he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performed “Tick Tock”</a> with <strong>Young Thug</strong>, 30, a week after Kim’s debut! Notably, Travis and his fiancée <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, 42, were both <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spoofed on the Oct. 2</a> episode by Kim in the “People’s Kourt” sketch. Kourt was also in-studio when Travis performed the next week, however, she did not appear on camera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5JpZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerGx055knZmmnrG0u81moqenpKnAbq7Eq6myZZaWv655z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
