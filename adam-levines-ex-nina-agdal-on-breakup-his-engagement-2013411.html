Asked in the latest issue of Ocean Drive magazine if the Levine split taught her anything about love, however, the Danish model is blunt. “No, it didn’t [teach me about love]. I am 21 years old, and I don’t think anyone who is 21 knows what love is about yet,” the Sports Illustrated 2012 “Rookie” muses."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I am 21 years old, and I don’t think anyone who is 21 knows what love is about yet,” the Sports Illustrated 2012 “Rookie” muses. Of Levine’s wedding plans <a href=#>with Prinsloo</a>, Agdal adds: “I think love just happens. It happened to them and I’m happy for them.”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Celebrities dating models</a></p><p>(Levine and Agdal <a href=#>started dating</a> immediately following the “Love Somebody” singer’s initial split from Prinsloo, whom he had dated from May 2012 to May 2013. A pal told Us that Agdal’s relationship with Levine fell apart in June after the Voice coach “went MIA on Nina and stopped answering her calls.” Levine, 34, then told Agdal about his engagement to Prinsloo, 24, in July <a href=#>via text</a>.)</p><p>The Ocean Drive cover girl adds philosophically about matters of the heart: “I am not even worried about anything like that. If something is meant to be, then it will be. I feel like so many young girls have this idea of a relationship or marriage or love and [they] don’t even know. We are 21 years old, okay? Go out, have a tequila, and stop worrying about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Besides, these days, Agdal has another rocker dude at her side: The Wanted’s <strong>Max George</strong>. “We’re very much in the honeymoon period. She’s awesome,” the British hunk, 25, told OK! last month. “She’s like a best mate as much as a girlfriend.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for the everyday pressures of her job as a model, Agdal (who recently flaunted her physique modeling swimwear for La Boheme) says, “There have been times when people have told me to lose weight or tone up certain areas. She then admits, “If somebody tells you to lose weight, it is like a punch in the face.”</p><p>The up-and-coming supermodel <a href=#>also shares</a> her thoughts on plastic surgery, which she believes is “fine” in small, incremental adjustments. “If you’ve had kids and you want your boobs lifted a little bit, of course you should get them lifted,” says the beauty. “If it makes you feel better, I’m totally for it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanJGieq2x1aKlnqtdmsVuusinmGaZl5murXnOp2SbqpWWuLa8jKGgrGWVo7Sis8SmnKesXWd9cn%2BTamho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
