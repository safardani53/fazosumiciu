Luxe, her fifth scent, is a departure from her previous ones, which boasted a beach-ier feeling, the actress tells PeopleStyle exclusively. “The others were all a little bit more of a California beach girl vibe, [so] I wanted to go in a more sensual direction, because I hadn’t really done that before,” says Aniston, who adds that she craved a concoction with “a little more depth, base and weight to it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I always have blotters around.” She continues, “I think it’s interesting that a perfume will smell different on one arm to another arm and also who sort of responds to certain ones. You are trying to satisfy a wide range which is a little challenging.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What does tie each of Aniston’s fragrances together is the bottle: As with her previous releases, she kept the same sculptural shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love architectural designs, and this sort of had a Frank Gehry vibe. Also it reflected an ocean wave in a way,” says Aniston, adding that she was also influenced by the atomizers her mother owned when she was growing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Remember when you were a kid and your mom would have these different bottles on her vanity, and they were always so beautiful? It just made me feel like I looked forward to being able to wear perfumes when I was a woman.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And Aniston’s learned a thing or two about scent etiquette since she started spritzing them on herself. “No one wants to go into an elevator and then walk out smelling like someone else! That’s something I have a pet peeve about: Someone giving you a hug and they’re loaded with some really horrible scent and you’re just like, ‘Oh now I smell like that person for the rest of the day!’ I hate that,” vents the actress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet the A-lister’s application method ensures you only get a faint whiff of eau de Aniston (not that you wouldn’t want to be awash in her aroma any day).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I usually also love to spray it in the air and run through it, so you have a hint of it, but you’re not overwhelmed by it,” she says of her spritzing MO.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqOcp6aZm7KzecCnoKysn6N6s7HLnpisnaNis6qy06Fkn6qRnL%2BiusKeZKWtqJp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
