In order to prepare for her role in Adrift as Tami Oldham Ashcroft — a sailor lost at sea with barely any food or way out — she lived off 350 calories for part of filming!&nbsp;“I can’t sleep when I’m hungry, so I would have a glass of wine to basically pass the f–k out,” Woodley admitted during an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Times</a>&nbsp;on June 28. “For the last two weeks I had a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Woodley stars alongside British actor, Sam Claflin in the film, who plays her boyfriend, Richard Sharp.&nbsp;“I don’t know that I could do it without Sam,” Woodley confessed. “We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger.” For her role as real-life sailor, Tami Oldham Ashcraft, Woodley tried to emulate what Ashcraft went through while lost at sea for 41-days. The actress said in order to maintain the strict diet, she would eat the minimal amount of food and skipped dinner, but it wasn’t easy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In another interview the actress&nbsp;described the long, draining hours she worked with her British co-star. “We were working extremely long hours out on the open sea. Sam and I were losing quite a bit of weight as we weren’t eating much,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New Paper</a>.&nbsp;“So not having the fuel to run you physically, along with the emotional complexities that were incredibly taxing at times, mixed with the physicality, it could have been a grueling experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shailene-woodley-drastic-305-calorie-diet-embed.jpg alt="Shailene Woodley 'Adrift'" width=620 height=414 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin in “Adrift,” in theaters now.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Adrift is a film based on the inspiring true story of two sailors who set out to journey across the ocean from Tahiti to San Diego.&nbsp;Tami Oldham, played by Woodley and Richard Sharp (Claflin) sail directly into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history on their love journey.
