The reality beauty is known for posing for photos on a regular basis for her brands, like SKIMS, and more promotional materials, and always looks incredible. Whether it’s featured on her stories or a main post, her fans are pretty much guaranteed to be treated to epic snapshots!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kim-kardashian-ray-j-sex-tape-claims-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before Kim’s latest outing, she made headlines for looking amazing while <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending<strong> Beyonce</strong>‘s 41st birthday party</a> last weekend. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>party</a> was disco-themed and she wore a sparkly dark red catsuit with black stripes as well as matching boots. She also rocked sunglasses and had her hair down as she walked outside of the location.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>When Kim’s not getting attention for her outfits at events, she’s doing so for her photos on the covers of magazines. Her most recent was the cover of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Interview magazine</a> and it was truly memorable. She looked unrecognizable with a mullet haircut and her eyebrows were dyed blonde. She also wore a denim jacket and showed off her bare behind as her jeans were pulled down.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Once the issue was out, Kim shared the cover photo on Instagram and received mixed reviews. Some loved the new look while others couldn’t bear such a change in appearance. “This looks nothing like Kim. I didn’t even recognize her until I read the caption,” one follower wrote in response to the post. Another compared the look to actress <strong>Uma Thurman</strong>, and some praised her for trying something different.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BtZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqSt06ysoqxdpbm2usaipaBllqe8r8CMpaasZZGjtKa4xKxkqK2knruoec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
