The machine keeps recycling this hot, dry air, making them very energy efficient.</p><p>While heat pump dryers cost less to run and are generally more environmentally friendly, they tend to dry clothes at a lower temperature and the programmes take longer.</p><h2>What is a condenser tumble dryer?</h2><p>A condenser tumble dryer uses very hot air to dry clothes and it collects the moisture from your clothes into a container located inside the dryer, which needs to be emptied after each load. This is ideal if you're not able to vent the moisture outside using a hose.</p><p>As condenser tumble dryers do not need an external hose they can be installed anywhere in your home and, on average, they dry clothes faster than a heat pump dryer.</p><h2>What is a vented tumble dryer?</h2><p>A vented tumble dryer draws and heats air from the room in which it’s located and expels the hot air and moisture through an external vent or hose.</p><p>While vented models are the cheapest on the market, they're also the least energy-efficient and often need to be installed by a professional as the hose leading out from the dryer needs to expel outdoors, either through a window or permanently fitted through an external wall.</p><h2>Do I need a vented, condensing or heat pump dryer?</h2><p>Where your dryer will be located will dictate what type you are able to buy. Vented models are the cheapest but they need to be professionally connected to a vent in an outside wall to get rid of moisture.</p><p>This isn’t physically possible in some homes, but there is an alternative: a condenser model.</p><p>This type of machine doesn’t require a vent so you can place it wherever you need to, however, the trade-off is that you will have to empty the wastewater container regularly.</p><p>You could also opt for one of the newer energy-efficient heat pump dryers – these also store excess water in a container.</p><p>Heat pump machines are also the most energy-efficient – they save energy by recycling the hot air they generate.</p><p>This does mean that some models take a bit longer to fully dry your clothes but with most high-end machines, this time difference is negligible.</p><h2>What size drum should I choose?</h2><p>Depending on the size of your household and the amount of washing you normally get through, most families will choose a machine with a 6kg to 10kg capacity drum.</p><p>You can dry a full-sized duvet in a 10kg model while on the other end of the scale, single-person households could opt for a tiny 4kg dryer.</p><h2>What features should I go for?</h2><p>Think carefully about features: it’s not worth paying for all the bells and whistles if you’re not actually going to use them.</p><p>The most expensive tumble dryer models tend to have the latest technology such as WiFi connectivity and specialised drying programmes for denim or linen.</p><p>However, don’t feel like you have to splash the cash in order to get a good dryer – it’s always worth doing some research as there are cheaper brands and models that have some of the fancier features that are very well reviewed too.</p><p>Useful features to look out for include sensor technology, which automatically senses when clothes are dry and turns off the machine. Quick-dry, Refresh and Delayed Start buttons can also prove useful for some households.</p><p>Read on for our recommendations of some of the best tumble dryers you can buy in 2021.</p><h2>How much does a tumble dryer cost to run?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Which</a>, the most efficient heat pump dryers cost just £26 per year to run, which is based on three loads per week, but this can rise to around £39 per year for less efficient models.</p><p>Condenser and vented dryers are less economical and can cost anywhere between £80 and £120 each year to run, depending on the energy efficiency of each individual model.</p><h2>How to clean a tumble dryer</h2><p>If you notice your clothes aren't coming out from your dryer quite as dry as they used to, or they're giving off a stale odour, it's probably time to give your tumble dryer a clean.</p><p>The lint filter should be cleaned out after every use to keep your dryer working well - to do this, make sure the appliance is fully cooled down. Locate the filter (usually just inside the door or on the front of the machine behind a door), remove lint with a brush and vacuum any stray pieces before popping it back in place.</p><p>For the inside of the drum, use warm water and white vinegar to wipe down the drum itself and the door seal to remove any mould or gunk. Leave the dryer door open to dry fully before using it again.</p><h2>Do tumble dryers shrink clothes?</h2><p>Tumble dryers can shrink clothes when used incorrectly – the combination of high heat that draws water from your clothes and the tumbling action means shrinkage is possible. Certain materials like natural animal fibres are also more prone to contract when exposed to heat.</p><p>To combat this, when drying delicate fabrics, it's best to opt for the lowest temperature setting you can. Always read care labels and don't tumble dry if the label indicates the garment isn't suitable.</p><h2>Where to put a tumble dryer in a small house?</h2><p>If you go for a vented tumble dryer you'll have to place it near a door or window in order for the hose to lead outside. For heat pump and condenser dryers, you have more options.</p><p>In smaller houses, if you have the luxury of a utility room, many people opt to stack their dryer on top of their washing machine using a stacking kit to save space. If this isn't an option or you don't have a utility room, another idea is to pop it in a garage.</p><p>Failing this, if you have a generous amount of storage space in your kitchen, another idea is to remove a cupboard for your tumble dryer.</p><h2>How to use a tumble dryer</h2><p>Make sure your clothes aren't sopping wet before loading them into your dryer – a quick spin cycle in your washing machine should remove excess water.</p><p>Untangle your clothes and load them into the dryer, checking the care labels for any delicate items to make sure they can be tumble-dried. Make sure you don't overload your dryer as your clothes won't dry if the machine is too packed. Separate clothes into two piles if there are too many for one load.</p><p>To reduce static, add a tumble dryer sheet inside the drum. These will also soften up rough fabrics and add a pleasant scent to your wash load.<br>Select a drying programme and press the start button.</p><p>Once the programme has finished, check to see if your washing is dry. Check larger items for wet spots and if needed, place any of those items back into the drum and set the timer for another 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>When your laundry is totally dry and the machine has cooled, empty the lint trap.</p><h2>What is the best tumble dryer?</h2><p>This is largely a matter of opinion and varies depending on your household's exact needs. Some of the top tumble dryer brands include Miele, Bosch, Beko and AEG.</p><h2>Where to buy tumble dryers</h2><p>Many of the big electrical retailers like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Currys PC World</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AO.com</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marks Electrical</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Argos</a> have an excellent range of tumble dryers.</p><p>See your local electrical store for good deals on discontinued models.</p><h2>How much do tumble dryers cost?</h2><p>Depending on the type of model you go for (as vented tumble dryers tend to cost less), prices for a tumble dryer range from around £200 for a very basic model and go all the way up to £1,500 for the biggest and best models.</p><p><strong>Want to find more savings on your online shopping?
