Quavo Suggests Swapping ExesRight off the bat, the bell of the hour was the late-night Instagram story that Quavo put on his official page, which read, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A source with the outlet spotted Lil Baby out shopping with Quavo's ex-girlfriend, Saweetie, in New York, where they ended up spending a hundred grand.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Get this! Lil Baby paid the bill. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The outlet further cited security camera footage that captured Lil Baby and Saweetie's shopping spree in the Chanel outlet in NYC.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lil Baby Pulled Back a Tweet</h2><p>As speculations and rumors took shape, one particular tweet from Lil Baby stood out like a sore thumb. His tweet from three days ago (as of this writing) said that he was not dating anyone and was single.&nbsp;</p><p>That doesn't seem to be the case anymore. The tweet is nowhere to be found. It looks like the green light from Saweetie's ex-boyfriend eased things up.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Of course, considering Quavo's latest story, Lil Baby&nbsp;taking down his 'single' tweet&nbsp;had other implications.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jayda Cheaves Chimed In&nbsp;</h2><p>The Shade Room wasted no time in sharing Quavo's story on their Instagram page, and guess who ended up liking the post? Pat yourself on the back if you answered Jayda Cheaves.</p><p>So, to add up, Lil Baby and Saweetie are almost definitely dating. Quavo seems to suggest that he and Lil Baby swap exes. And, of course, Cheaves seemingly approves of the idea.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When everyone thought that the news was as good as official, Quavo's sister, who goes by the Migo Shara on Instagram, gave Quavo her blessing.&nbsp;Shara posted a story of Cheaves on her private Instagram page.</p><p>With all of this drama unfolding overnight, literally, Cheaves&nbsp;and Quavo&nbsp;have made it to the top of Twitter's Trending in Rap list. Cheaves&nbsp;ranked #1, followed by&nbsp;Quavo.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Cheaves&nbsp;supposedly told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Shade Room</a> that people got her trending on Twitter for no apparent reason. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><h2>About the Relationships Before All of This</h2><p><a href=# rel=follow>Lil Baby and Cheaves</a> had been dating on and off for the last couple of years. Their relationship resulted in them welcoming a baby into their family in February 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>But less than a year later, the couple had confirmed on separate occasions that they had broken up. While there were quite a few on and off moments from then till now, recent developments suggest Saweetie was the final nail in that coffin.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Saweetie and Quavo</a> have a much straight forward relationship, though. They began dating in 2018 after the latter slipped into her DMs. They dated for almost three whole years before Saweetie announced she was single via a Twitter post on March 19, 2021, and that was that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKmllsOwecmasJ2ZXZi1pq3VnqpmnKKWuqJ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
