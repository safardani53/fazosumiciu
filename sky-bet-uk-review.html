We also look at the latest offers in 2023, how to sign up, deposit, place a bet, and withdraw.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Things we love about Sky Bet</strong></h2><p>There are various excellent features on the Sky Bet UK platform, and below we list three of the top ones:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Things to improve at Sky Bet&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Below are two things we think the Sky Bet website could improve on:</p><ul><li>Max daily winnings limited to £500,000</li><li>No shortcut to the live chat</li></ul><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£30 in free bets when you place any bet</p><p>New customers only.

BeGambleAware.org</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Latest Sky Bet offers and bonuses for sports</strong></h2><p>Sky Bet offers multiple promotions to UK punters, from a welcome bonus to prize drops. However, all promotions have different <a href=# aria-label="terms and requirements (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">terms and requirements</a>, so we look at the individual offers. You can only claim one bonus at a time and opt in to the offer through the Promotions page. The bookie also often restricts Neteller and Skrill deposits from being eligible for promotions.</p><p>However, some promotions require email entries, while others automatically apply on qualifying wagers. You can see the particular bonus terms and conditions on the Promotions page, and the minimum deposit to claim a bonus is £5, with a 5p+ bet requirement. However, this can also vary according to the promotion.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Welcome bonus</strong></h3><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£30 in free bets when you place any bet</p><p>New customers only. First single & e/w bet only. 5p minimum stake. Odds of 1/1 or greater. 3 x £10 bet tokens. Free bet stakes not included in returns. Free bets exclude virtuals. Free bets are non withdrawable. Free bets expire after 30 days. Eligibility restrictions and further T&Cs apply. 18+. BeGambleAware.org</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><p>The welcome offer is a £30 free bets promotion, and the minimum deposit to claim it is £5. Once you register and verify your account and deposit at least £5, you can place a 5p+ wager to receive the free bets. You get three £10 free bets, which you can use together on one wager or separately on different single or each-way market wagers.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also vital to note that virtuals aren’t eligible markets to use free bets with. When you’ve selected your bet, you can click the orange gift icon next to the bet amount box to use your free bets.&nbsp;</p><p>Only your first bet will count towards the promotion requirements and that you have 30 days to make an eligible wager to claim the offer. The free bets also have a 30-day expiry period.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Accumulator bonuses</strong></h3><p>This UK bookmaker offers some <a href=# aria-label="accumulator bonuses (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">accumulator bonuses</a>, like when they provide enhanced accumulators like the Soccer Saturday Price Boost. However, it’s a special bet type, and the bookie lists it on specific matches and markets for a limited period. Generally, these offers are eligible for specific football matches.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Offers by sports</strong></h3><p>There are other offers available that punters can claim. One is the Sky Bet Prize Drop, which you must opt-in to join. You can win shirts, tickets, and other perks like vouchers, TVs, PS5s, etc. It’s free to enter your details into the prize draw, but you can only enter it once. You’ll be notified within 14 days when you’ve won a prize.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet Prize Drop</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Win tickets, shirts and perks!</p><p>Opt in required. Prizes will vary.

However, these promotions are time-limited offers, so keep an eye on the promotions page to find new daily, weekly, and monthly offers. Other thing you will find in the Promotions page are Sky Bet Betting Guides, various in play offers, Expert Tips, and info on the tools of Profit & Loss and BuildaBet.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to sign up at Sky Bet - Step by step</strong></h2><p>Like with any <a href=# aria-label="new betting platform (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">new betting platform</a>, you need to sign up. And it’s relatively easy to create your account, but UK punters should know they must verify their account before depositing. Below, we provide a step-by-step guide on creating your account on whichever device you prefer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Desktop:</strong></h3><li><strong>Click the “Join” link</strong> at the top right of the screen, right below the Sky logos.</li><li><strong>Add your personal details</strong>, like your name and surname.</li><li><strong>Add your date of birth</strong> before clicking the green “Next” button.</li><li><strong>Enter the first line of your address</strong>, ensuring it’s the one registered with your bank.</li><li>Your email and phone number are the last two personal details you must add.</li><li>The second step is to <strong>create your account login</strong>, requiring your username, security question, and pin.</li><li><strong>Provide your card payment details</strong> and verify your account.</li><li><strong>Opt-in to use the welcome bonus</strong>.</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong><a href=# aria-label="Mobile (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mobile</a>:</strong></h3><li><strong>Use Google Play or the App Store</strong> to download the Sky Bet mobile app.</li><li><strong>Follow the prompts</strong> to add your personal information.</li><li><strong>Create your account details</strong>, like a username, secure pin, and security questions.</li><li><strong>Verify your account</strong> and add a payment method.</li><li><strong>Choose whether to opt in for the welcome bonus</strong> or go without it.</li><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£30 in free bets when you place any bet</p><p>New customers only.

BeGambleAware.org</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to place a bet</strong> at Sky Bet</h2><p>Once your UK account is verified, and you’ve made your first deposit, you can start betting. Punters can browse over 35 sports, with hundreds of betting selections.</p><li><strong>Navigate to the sports betting page</strong>.</li><li><strong>Select the sport you want to bet on</strong> using the left sidebar or top tabs.</li><li><strong>Browse </strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the selection of odds</strong> available in the market</a>.</li><li>To add a wager to your bet slip, <strong>click on the match odds you want</strong> to place a stake on.</li><li><strong>Add the amount you want to bet</strong>, and approve the wager.</li><li>You can see all your current bets on the right-side bet slip.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to get the most out of live streaming with Sky Bet</strong></h2><p>Some matches have live streams available on both desktop and mobile apps. Click the “<a href=# aria-label="In-Play (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">In-Play</a>” or “What’s On” headings in the left sidebar to see current live streams. A green play icon will be next to the match, which you click to watch the stream.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also activate notifications on the app, which means the UK bookie will automatically notify you when a new live stream starts. However, not all matches will have a live stream. In that case, you can use the ScoreCentre for a detailed analysis and breakdown of how the match is going.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to claim your bonus</strong></h2><p>Claiming your <a href=# aria-label="bonus (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">bonus</a> is relatively easy at this UK bookmaker. Still, we list the steps below, so you can ensure you know what to do to receive the welcome offer.</p><li>While registering, <strong>select the welcome offer</strong> you want to claim at the end of the registration.</li><li><strong>Deposit £5 or more</strong> using a debit card, Google Pay, or Apple Pay.</li><li><strong>Place a single wager</strong> on 5p+ stakes within 30 days.</li><li>You’ll automatically receive the three £10 free bets, which you must use within 30 days.</li><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£30 in free bets when you place any bet</p><p>New customers only. First single & e/w bet only. 5p minimum stake. Odds of 1/1 or greater. 3 x £10 bet tokens. Free bet stakes not included in returns. Free bets exclude virtuals. Free bets are non withdrawable. Free bets expire after 30 days. Eligibility restrictions and further T&Cs apply. 18+. BeGambleAware.org</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sky Bet payment methods</strong></h2><p>Sky Bet only accepts debit cards and Google or Apple Pay. While e-wallets like <a aria-label="PayPal (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PayPal</a> (and it still is for existing users), <a aria-label="Neteller (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neteller</a>, and <a href=# aria-label="Skrill (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skrill</a> used to be accepted, new UK punters can only make accounts and add card payment methods. The accepted debit cards are <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa</a>, Mastercard, Maestro, and Solo.</p><p>Before you can deposit at Sky Bet, you must also verify your account. However, the verification is fast, using your debit card information to verify your identity.</p><p>Credit cards aren’t available due to United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) regulations, and you can add up to three debit cards to your account. However, if you don’t want to use cards, then <a href=# aria-label="Apple Pay (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Pay</a> and <a href=# aria-label="Google Pay (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Pay</a> are also available on mobile, provided they’re not linked with a credit card.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sky Bet withdrawal options&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When it comes to withdrawals, you have all the deposit methods available, as you must withdraw using a method you’ve deposited with. You’ll see a Net Amount listed next to each withdrawal method, which shows you how much you can withdraw using those payment methods.</p><p>Sometimes, the UK bookmaker may need to verify your account further, especially if you’re requesting large withdrawals. This process will require you to provide copies of your identification, bank statement, proof of address, and other requested documents.</p><p>The minimum withdrawal is £10, and the bookmaker processes the withdrawal request within two to five days. The only time the bookie processes it on the same day is for existing PayPal and other e-wallet users. There are no fees or maximum withdrawal limits, but the payment processor might have some.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What is the minimum deposit&nbsp; at Sky Bet?</strong></h2><p>The minimum deposit is £5, but it’s £10 for existing UK PayPal users. Deposits are generally available in your account as soon as your bank authorizes it, meaning it’s near instant. The £5 minimum deposit is below the average, giving this bookmaker points in its favour when compared to other platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to use cash out feature</strong> at Sky Bet</h2><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cash Out feature</a> allows you to withdraw your bet and possible winnings before a match is done. While it’s not available on all wagers, you’ll see a green arrow loop symbol to show when it’s possible. You can also look at your bet lists, and there’ll be a heading stating cash Out Bets, which lists all your wagers eligible for <a aria-label="early cashout (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>early cashout</a>.</p><p>Your cash-out value will be a calculation of the amount you bet, the price/odds at the time you placed the bet, and the current price/odds. However, the maximum cash-out amount is £500,000. Generally, you need to cash out while the team you bet on is still in the lead.</p><p>There’s also the two-up promotion available to UK punters. This promotion means the bookmaker immediately settles you as the winner if your team leads by two goals. It’s an ongoing promotion on the platform you can make use of if you’re not sure whether the stake will be successful.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Free bets and more punters can enjoy</strong></h2><p>Overall, Sky Bet is a trustworthy UK platform, delivering various promotions and many betting opportunities. This bookmaker gives you various free bets, from the welcome offer to time-limited promotions. Prize Drops, jackpots, and more are also available in its sports section.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sky Bet sign up offer</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/thesun-skybet-sportsbook-bonuses-1-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>£30 in free bets when you place any bet</p><p>New customers only.

If there’s something we’d criticize, it’s the winnings limit and the unnecessarily long route you take to chat with support agents. However, the UKGC licenses this bookmaker, and it offers all the features and promotions you want.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More reviews of online UK bookmakers from our betting experts</h2><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Betting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7RwfpFxaGpsYml8tLfYZpmerF2quG6%2BxK%2Bgnq9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
