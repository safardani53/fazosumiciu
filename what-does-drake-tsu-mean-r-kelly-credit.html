Kelly, while currently on trial for sexual abuse of countless Black women and girls, is going to be making money off the most anticipated album of the year thanks to Drake giving him a songwriting credit on&nbsp;#CertifiedLoverBoy&nbsp;And that's why both&nbsp;#CLB&nbsp;and&nbsp;#DONDA&nbsp;are trash."</p><h2>Why did R. Kelly get a credit on CLB?</h2><p>Kelly's credit is due to song publishing rights as TSU samples his 1998 single "Half on a Baby."</p><p>In order to use the samples from Kelly's song, Drake had to acquire legal permission as well as give him songwriting royalties.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> is also credited on the new album because Drake uses NSYNC’s version of Christopher Cross’s “Sailing.”</p><p>Prior to his legal battles, Kelly's songs were frequently sampled by other artists including:</p><p>“It just speaks to his genius and the demand for his work. I mean, he’s a literary genius, it doesn’t surprise me," Kelly's attorney Devereaux Cannick said of the credit. "I don’t think it’s that much about the money, I think the public and other artists want his participation. I’m sure he’s totally unaware of it because he’s consumed right now but I will share with him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000461800618.jpg><h2>Did Certified Lover Boy break Apple Music records?</h2><p>While controversy surrounds TSU, the rest of the album continues to break records.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from drake</h2></p><p>Following the release of Drake's sixth album, his songs “Girls Want Girls (feat.
