Their dynamic relationship brings a lot to the table, adding more depth to their rivalry and friendship.</p><h2>'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'</h2><p>Captain America is a fan favorite of many MCU lovers and the reason it is well-beloved lies majorly on the success of&nbsp;the second&nbsp;Captain America installment.</p><p>Not only is Captain America: The Winter Soldier considered the best MCU movie by many, it also does a brilliant job fleshing out who Captain America is and what he stands for. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>While Captain America: The First Avenger sees Steven G. Rogers turning into a soldier who knows the value of power, Captain America: The Winter Soldier explores his transformation into a leader.</p><p>And while all of this is happening, the movie brilliantly nods back to the character’s origin and values, adding more layers to his relationship with The Winter Soldier.</p><p>This movie also introduced the partnership between Captain America and Falcon, a superhero duo that would eventually spawn the hit series, <a href=# rel=follow>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</a> (2021). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>'Doctor Strange'</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>When looking at it from a strict origins story standpoint, Doctor Strange&nbsp;bears resemblance to&nbsp;Iron Man more than Captain America. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Both Tony Stark and Stephen Strange undergo a metamorphosis, changing from people drunk on their success to individuals who really care about everything around them.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you liked Captain America: The First Avenger, Doctor Strange is a great watch. Like most superhero origin movies, the script follows a certain formula, tapping into similar sentiments and plotlines. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>But that changes nothing. Doctor Strange is still a brilliant movie that takes the same ingredients as other superhero-origin movies and yet turns it into a completely interesting and unique dish.</p><p>The movie introduced sorcery, magic, different realities, and dimensions to the already expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. And if that isn’t enough to convince you to give this movie a shot, you should also consider the fact that this movie is an absolute visual marvel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>To this day, Doctor Strange is considered by many to be the MCU&nbsp;movie with the best visual. When Inception first came out, the folding city impressed most of the viewers but&nbsp;Doctor Strange takes&nbsp;it up several notches, creating a visual piece that’s unlike anything that has been created before. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>'Black Panther'</h2><p>After the stage was set for introducing Wakanda in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther finally came out in February 2018. The movie explored the futuristic state of Wakanda and its soon-to-be-crowned king, T’Challa (played by the late Chadwick Boseman). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Black Panther is regarded as a major milestone in any superhero movie for representing the first black superhero. Even before it came out, the movie was already on the must-watch list for millions of people all over the world.</p><p>It was an incredibly hyped movie and when it came out, it lived up to all the expectations that were placed on it. It hit a chord with people from different origins and races by tackling complicated themes about identity head-on.</p><p>Also, the action-packed sequences coupled with comedic scenes now and then make for a super entertaining watch.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>'Black Widow'</h2><p>Like Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, <a href=# rel=follow>Black Widow</a> sees Natasha Romanoff revisiting her past. Not only is it Black Widow’s first standalone movie but also the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four.</p><p>Set before the events of Avengers: Endgame, Black Widow sees Romanoff wrestling with her past of being a part of a Soviet military program that brainwashed and turned hundreds of little girls into Soviet spies.</p><p>And just like Rogers does in Captain America: Civil War, Romanoff too teams up with her former colleagues to face the demons from her past. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRpcGitc1mmKadop6wonnToZxmnpmnwLV5wK%2Bcp5%2BVp3quu9WinKxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
