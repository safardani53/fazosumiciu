Greig Spence, 30, was left with little more than a Mohican strip on top as his barnet thinned.
He got some mild taunts from pals and was on the verge of shaving off what was left until he read about the possibility of a transplant.
Greig decided to bite the bullet and use cash that he’d saved up during lockdown to pay for the procedure."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was horrendous.</p><p>“People made jokes about getting a <a href=# aria-label="hair transplant (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hair transplant</a> and then I noticed how many other folk were getting it done.</p><p>“I’m so chuffed I’ve done it. It’s given me so much confidence and I get loads of compliments about it.”</p><p>Greig, who runs his own firm, reckons there needs to be an end to the stigma of men getting work done.</p><p>He added: “If women can get their face or boobs fixed, why can’t we get our hair sorted?</p><p>“It’s such a massive thing that has a huge impact on how you look. I’d say to anyone who was thinking about it to just go for it. You won’t regret it.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Greig got in touch with firm Longevita who arranged for his three day hotel stay in Istanbul and the surgery. He had to pay for his own flights.</p><p>The op started with him getting about 14 painful injections into his head. But after that he didn’t feel anything during the seven-hour procedure and even nodded off.</p><p>He flew home and had to stop playing football for a while because he wasn’t allowed to get his head wet.</p><p>Greig said: “The hardest bit was probably waiting for it to come through.</p><p>“It happened all of a sudden and just looks brilliant now.”</p><p>Greig said his fiancee wanted him to go completely bald, but is now loving his new look.</p><p>While pals he’s not seen for a while can’t believe he’s suddenly got a full head of hair.</p><p>He said: “It makes me look a bit younger and just overall so much better.</p><p>“I’m so glad that I went for it. People might be put off by the cost. But it’s something that is going to last me the rest of my life so is a no-brainer really.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FpanJxaGyBcLTAoqlmrKKWu7S8y5qlrWWkqr%2Bssdhmm66mlpq%2FrrjIp5xmqJyquqOx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
