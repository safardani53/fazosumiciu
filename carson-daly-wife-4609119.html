Carson has been known for his long-running career on TV, from his days in the 90s, hosting TRL on MTV to his late-night show to his career on a morning talk show. The personality has been in the spotlight for years! The couple met while working on his late-night show, and their relationship has been going strong ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Carson-Daly-Siri-Pinter-ss-ebed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Most recently, she gushed over Carson via Instagram for their 7th wedding anniversary in Dec. 2022. “It’s a rainy, oddly warm day today… just like it was 7 years ago.

Find out everything you need to know about Carson Daly’s wife Siri here!</p><h2>How Did Carson & His Wife Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Carson and Siri have only been married for seven years, but they’ve been together for over a decade! The former TRL&nbsp;host met his future wife back when he was a late night host. Siri was a writer’s assistant for his show&nbsp;Last Call With Carson Daly,&nbsp;which aired from 2002 to 2019. “She would walk into our meetings and I would look at the other dudes in the room, like, ‘Do you see what I see?’ It was undeniable,” Carson told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. The pair later got engaged in 2013, and they finally tied the knot right before Christmas 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/carsondaly_siripinter_embed2.jpg><h2>Siri Is a Food Blogger</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>While Carson has been a staple of various talk shows throughout his career, Siri made a name for herself by running a food blog called “Siriously Delicious.” In 2018, she published a cookbook with the same name:&nbsp;Siriously Delicious: 100 Nutrious (And Not So Nutritious) Simple Recipes for the Real Home Cook. She’s also been able to use her talents as a cook to become a food correspondent alongside her husband for&nbsp;Today.</p><h2>They Have Four Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Together, Carson and Siri have four beautiful children. They had their first three children before getting married, and they had their youngest in March 2020. They have one son <strong>Jackson James,&nbsp;</strong>13, and three daughters <strong>Etta,&nbsp;</strong>9,&nbsp;<strong>London,&nbsp;</strong>7, and&nbsp;<strong>Goldie, </strong>2. After Goldie’s birth during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID pandemic</a>, Carson thanked the medical staff for all their help with the birth amid the coronavirus pandemic. “The Daly family wants to send a special shout out to the incredibly brave & selfless medical staff at our hospital in New York and also the many courageous people on the front lines of this dreadful virus. We thank God not only for the safe birth of our daughter, but for their tireless work attending to so many in need,” he wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/carsondaly_siripinter_embed.jpg><h2>Siri’s Dad Is An Actor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>It should be no surprise that Siri has become an entertainer as a food correspondent on&nbsp;Today. Her father&nbsp;<strong>Mark,&nbsp;</strong>71, has been a working actor for years. He made his first appearance in a 1978 TV movie, and he’s taken on roles in a wide variety of projects. Most notably, he’s appeared in a ton of soap operas, including&nbsp;General Hospital&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Young And The Restless. He’s also made appearances in a few episodes of critically acclaimed shows like&nbsp;Mad Men&nbsp;and&nbsp;Narcos: Mexico. He’s also taken on a few minor movie roles in flicks like&nbsp;Vanilla Sky.</p><h2>She’s Worked Behind The Scenes On TV</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>As mentioned before, Siri met Carson while she was a writer’s assistant on his show, but she’s actually worked on a number of different projects before becoming a TV personality herself. She was an associate producer for Carson’s New Year’s Eve special in 2008. Other projects that she was an assistant on the classic sitcom&nbsp;Frasier,&nbsp;Committed,&nbsp;the TV movie Nobody’s Watching, and an episode of&nbsp;Last Comic Standing, according to her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb page</a>.</p><h2>Siri Has Gushed Over Carson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The couple celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary together in December 2021. After years together, the pair seem so in love with each other. Siri penned an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a> with photos from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their special day</a> to celebrate their anniversary. “I can’t even remember how many more… that’s because life with you and our family has felt like forever,” she wrote in the post. “I can’t even remember a before. I love you [Carson Daly]… Happy Anniversary!”</p><h2>Carson Was Engaged To Tara Reid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Carson-Daly-Relationship-History-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Before he met Siri, Carson was once engaged to American Pie actress <strong>Tara Reid, </strong>46. At the height of&nbsp;TRL’s&nbsp;success, the pair met on set and got engaged in October 2000, but they broke off their relationship in June 2001. In retrospect, Carson admitted that it was probably for the best that their relationship panned out the way it did. “To some extent, I dodged a bullet. I was getting serious about my career, and she wanted to shoot movies and just party in her time off. That didn’t work for me,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a>&nbsp;in 2012.</p><h2>He Dated Jennifer Love Hewitt</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Back in the 90s, Carson was romantically involved with&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer&nbsp;star&nbsp;<strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt,&nbsp;</strong>43. The pair got together in 1997, as Jennifer was a rising star, but the pair’s breakup came abruptly, especially for Carson! The former VJ admitted that he learned about the breakup from hearing about it on&nbsp;<strong>Howard Stern’s&nbsp;</strong>radio show in a&nbsp;People&nbsp;interview, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>. Despite getting blindsided by the breakup, Carson was able to joke with Jennifer when she appeared on his talk show in 2005. “I just want to start here, and I don’t want it to be weird for you, but I think it’s important that I say this: I think it’s about time we start seeing other people,” he joked with her when she was on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Last Call</a>. He playfully ran through career moments that she had around the time that they broke up.</p><h2>He Was Rumored To Have Dated Christina Aguilera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Carson-Daly-Relationship-History-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>While his relationships with Siri and Tara are his most famous, there was once a rumor that he was briefly involved with&nbsp;<strong>Christina Aguilera,&nbsp;</strong>41, who was later a judge on the Carson-hosted The Voice. The rumor was famously referenced in <strong>Eminem’s </strong>song “The Real Slim Shady.” While the pair haven’t addressed the rumor, Carson once responded to a question by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair&nbsp;</a>in 2012asking about Christina, with an answer that seemed to shut down the rumor. When asked about his thoughts on very personal details about the “Genie in a Bottle” singer’s sexuality, Carson deflected. “Are you kidding me? Is that your opener? I have no idea. I can’t imagine the thought. I mean, really,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KaqaynnmKxorjYZq6inpVigXd8mGpocmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
