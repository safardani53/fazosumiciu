Itâ€™s far from certain with Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal all facing tricky away tests in front of the TV cameras.
Champions Manchester City should have things easier though when they host rock-bottom Sheffield United.
Three of those four games feature in our five-legged accumulator across Saturday and Sunday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thereâ€™s also a treble for those less convinced!</p><p>A Â£10 wager on our treble would pay out Â£42.80, while the same stake on our accumulator produces a potential return of Â£178.20.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ðŸ¥… <strong><strong><strong>Luton vs Chelsea: Both teams to score (3/4)</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Each team has landed this bet in eight of their last 10 games so the price here just looks wrong.</p><p>Both have struggled for clean sheets â€“ Luton have just one this season, while Chelsea have only kept out lowly Sheffield United since October 2.</p><p>The Hatters have picked up of late, winning three of their last six, while theyâ€™ve been tough to beat all season at Kenilworth Road where they are yet to lose by more than one goal and have scored in all bar one of their matches.</p><p>Chelsea continue to create chances â€“ as their second place in the expected-goals table shows - and should do so against a team with the second-worst expected goals total.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>âš½ <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Add both teams to score to your acca at 3/4 at bet365</a> âš½</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ðŸ¥… <strong>Aston Villa vs Burnley: Villa to win (4/11)</strong></h2><p>Villa have stuttered over Christmas, picking up just one point as they missed the chance to go top of the table.</p><p>However, itâ€™s been far from disastrous â€“ a close decision denying them the lead against Sheffield United, a game they ended up drawing, while they led 2-0 at Old Trafford before losing but not before missing a couple of great second-half chances.</p><p>Expect a response at Villa Park where the draw against the Blades ended a run of 15 straight league wins on home soil.</p><p>Burnley have avoided defeat in three of their six games so far this month but they look up against it here given Villaâ€™s efforts at home where theyâ€™ve netted 26 goals and conceded only eight, both figures being league bests.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>âš½ <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Put Villa to win in your acca at 4/11 at bet365</a> âš½</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ðŸ¥… <strong>Manchester City vs Sheffield United: City to win both halves (4/5)</strong></h2><p>The leagueâ€™s best attack against the leagueâ€™s worst defence looks likely to have only one outcome, especially after Cityâ€™s impressive second-half comeback at Goodison Park on Wednesday night.</p><p>Despite a relatively poor run of results, City head into the second half of the season just five points off the pace and with a game in hand. That already feels like a chance missed by the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal.</p><p>Donâ€™t expect another slip-up here with City having a fine home record against the newly-promoted clubs.</p><p>Theyâ€™ve landed the win-both-halves bet in five of their last six against such opposition at the Etihad where itâ€™s hard to see the Blades keeping them out, especially with Anel Ahmedhodzic and Gustavo Hamer both suspended.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>âš½ <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">City to win both halves at 4/5 at bet365</a> âš½</strong></p><p>Add the following two bets to make it a 5-fold acca.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ðŸ¥… <strong>Tottenham vs Bournemouth: Draw/Bournemouth double chance (evens)</strong></h2><p>Spurs took another step back on Thursday when they were battered by Brighton and, frankly, they were fortunate to beat Everton at home in their previous game.</p><p>Therefore Bournemouth look to have a great chance of taking something from their trip to north London.</p><p>After all, theyâ€™ve been on a fantastic run which has seen 22 of a possible 30 points collected â€“ no side has managed more over the same period.</p><p>Dominic Solanke is on fire and having scored in four of his last five games, heâ€™s now on 12 for the season in the league â€“ only Erling Haaland has more.</p><p>That should be a worry for a Spurs backline which has struggled ever since Mickey van de Venâ€™s injury and the odds about the Cherries avoiding defeat just look too tempting to ignore.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>âš½</strong> <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Back Draw/Bournemouth double chance at evens at bet365</a> âš½</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ðŸ¥… <strong>Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United: Under 2.5 goals (43/40)</strong></h2><p>There have been plenty of goals in Nuno Espirito Santoâ€™s first two games in charge of Forest but heâ€™s known as a pretty defensive coach â€“ just ask Spurs fans â€“ and the unders appeal here.</p><p>This bet has delivered for its backers in six of Unitedâ€™s nine away games so far.</p><p>Those matches have seen just 17 goals with only Sheffield United unable to match the Red Devilsâ€™ tally of eight away goals scored. At the same time, only Arsenal have a better defensive record on the road.</p><p>Under 2.5 goals has also landed more often than not at the City Ground, so it gets the nod.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>âš½ <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Select under 2.5 goals at 43/40 at bet365</a> âš½</strong></p><br><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesnâ€™t gamble if theyâ€™re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare â€“&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware â€“&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>Find our <a href=# aria-label="detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here</a>.</p><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Betting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7RwfpRqcG5qYWd8p7vOrZmapJxirqSvwGZqaWVjZnqlscKepJudomJ%2FcX6SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
