In a <a href=# rel=noopener>new photo</a> circulating via social media, Swift wrapped one arm around Kelce as they posed with Chiefs quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> and his wife, <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, who leaned in close to her new pal Swift.</p><p>Both Swift and Brittany, 28, wore sparkly dresses for the bash. The pop star rocked her signature red lipstick and styled her hair in a low bun with her bangs swept to the side.</p><p>While neither Swift nor Kelce have shared footage of their own from the party, fellow attendees gave glimpses of the couple cozying up to one another on the dance floor. A video that has since gone viral showed the twosome <a href=#>sharing a passionate kiss</a> as the party raged on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Inside-Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-Kansas-City-New-Year-Eve-Party.jpg><p>New clips of the pair’s big night surfaced after New Year’s Day. In one video reshared via <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a>, Kelce jumped up and down while dancing with his friends — and Swift could be seen joining in behind the group.</p><p>The twosome also posed for selfies throughout the night, with Kelce sticking out his tongue for the camera in one shot. Swift cuddled up to his side, and eagle-eyed fans noticed that her lipstick had mysteriously disappeared from her face.</p><p lang=da dir=ltr>📸| NYE celebrations😚 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q6IAp0HFC6</a></p><p>— Taylor Swift Updates 🩵 (@swifferupdates) <a href=#>January 2, 2024</a></p><p>Before the clock struck midnight, <a href=#>Swift donned her Chiefs gear</a> to cheer for Kelce and his team on Sunday. She rocked a varsity jacket similar to one Kelce had on while arriving at Arrowhead Stadium for his Christmas Day game a week prior. When designer <strong>Jeff Hamilton</strong> shared a glimpse of the matching moment via Instagram after the game, Kelce was caught hyping up his girlfriend in the comments section with fire emojis.</p><p>Swift was first spotted supporting Kelce in September, two months after he gave her a shout-out on his “New Heights” podcast. At the time, Kelce noted that he wanted to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it when he went to one of her Eras Tour concerts in Kansas City.</p><a title=@mrbridgerton href=#>@mrbridgerton</a><p>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift NYE ✨ . . . <a title=traviskelce href=#>#traviskelce</a> <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a> <a title=kcchiefs href=#>#kcchiefs</a> <a title=tayvis href=#>#tayvis</a> <a title=swifttok href=#>#swifttok</a> <a title=traviskelce87 href=#>#traviskelce87</a></p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Joanna 🫧" href=#>♬ original sound – Joanna 🫧</a></p><p>Swift told TIME magazine in December 2023 that she thought Kelce’s move was “metal as hell,” revealing that <a href=#>the pair “started hanging out right after”</a> the podcast episode dropped.</p><p>“We actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,” she added. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kelce has continued to make subtle references to Swift on his podcast since, and he opened up about what <a href=#>makes their relationship so special</a> during a November 2023 interview with WSJ. Magazine. “I’ve never been a man of words,” he said. “Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f—ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Inside-Taylor-Swift-and-Travis-Kelce-Kansas-City-New-Year-Eve-Party-Brittany-Mahomes-and-Patrick-Mahomes.jpg><p>He further weighed in on the public’s interest in their romance. “Obviously I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them … I’ve never dealt with it,” he said. “But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it. … The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that, I better not be the one acting all strange.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZK2qkau2tHnKnqOcnaNiuKK60pqqZpuZqcZuusSwZLKdkafAbrHVnmSpmaKpxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
