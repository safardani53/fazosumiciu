Isolate</h2><p>Norovirus is super transmissible, so the best thing you can do when you get it is to isolate from other people.</p><p>"Due to how contagious the virus is you should isolate yourself and stay off work and school until you have a full 24 hours without any symptoms," Dr Winn said.</p><p>"This will prevent you from transmitting it to anyone else."</p><p>The <a href=#>NHS</a> recommends staying off work and keeping your child away from school until you or they haven't been sick or had diarrhoea for at least two days.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Stay hydrated</h2><p>"The main symptoms of&nbsp;norovirus&nbsp;are severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which means that you lose fluids at an extreme rate," Dr Winn went on.</p><p>This makes dehydration a risk - but there are a few ways to keep it at bay.</p><p>"Making sure you are drinking enough water is vital so as to replace electrolytes and fluids," according to the medical director, who recommended rehydration sachets.</p><p>"We recommend taking small sips of water every 10 minutes or so to see if your stomach can handle it because drinking too much too quickly will lead to further vomiting.</p><p>"If you find yourself able to keep down little sips, gradually increase how often you take them."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Rest as much as you can</h2><p>Norovirus can last two or three days and sadly, the only thing you can do "is to let it run its course", Dr Winn said.</p><p>"Resting will not only help you feel more energised once the symptoms have eased, but can also prevent symptoms such as dehydration from worsening," he added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Wash your hands</h2><p>It's super important that you regularly wash your hands.</p><p>Hand sanitiser just <a href=#>won't do the job of killing the germs</a> on your hands so it's important you use soap and warm water every time.</p><p>You should also be wiping down any surfaces you use or come into contact with to remove any germs and reduce the risk of further transmitting the virus.</p><p>"This is especially important if you share a house with other people and use communal areas," Dr Winn emphasised.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. The foods to avoid</h2><p>"Spicy, greasy and dairy-based products can exacerbate digestive discomfort," Dr Winn warned, so it's best to steer well clear of these when you're suffering from norovirus.</p><p>"Stick to bland, plain <a href=#>food</a> such as dry toast or crackers," the medical expert advised.</p><p>But avoiding dehydration should be the focus.</p><p>"You may find that you have no appetite at all during the first 24 hours, so really focus on keeping down enough fluid," Dr Winn added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Take painkillers</h2><p>Aside from feeling and being sick, you might also develop <a href=#>a temperature</a> and an achy head and limbs when you're infected with the nasty bug.</p><p>"If you develop a fever, <a href=#>take some anti-fever medication</a> such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to help ease the discomfort," Dr Winn advised.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. <strong>Know when to seek help</strong></h2><p>"Most&nbsp;norovirus&nbsp;cases do not require medical attention and due to how contagious the virus is, you should refrain from going to the <a href=#>hospital</a> or the doctor," the medical expert said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"However, if you are becoming severely dehydrated, cannot drink any fluids or have a high temperature for an extended period of time, it is important to seek medical attention as the virus may be affecting you more severely.&nbsp;</p><p>"Norovirus&nbsp;also affects the elderly, young children and those with an underlying <a href=#>health</a> condition more than the average adult, so make sure to monitor the symptoms closely and be ready to seek medical help if they worsen."&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What are the symptoms of norovirus?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>The main symptoms of norovirus are:</p><ul><li>feeling sick (nausea)</li><li>diarrhoea</li><li>being sick (vomiting)</li></ul><p>You may also have:</p><ul><li>a high temperature</li><li>a headache</li><li>aching arms and legs</li></ul><p>The symptoms start suddenly within one to two days of being infected.</p><p class=has-text-align-right>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The NHS</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgY9scGxoZWTEqa3TZpuoZZmberq71Gafmq6VYruwvs6voKuto2KzsLvDrGStp12Ww7C1w2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
