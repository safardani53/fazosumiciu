So, every night when she went to bed, Cena was there to watch over her.</p><p class=p1>“So I slept in a room for two years with a life-size cardboard cut-out of John Cena in the room,” she added, explains that seeing his 2-D face in the corner of the room would startle her if she woke up in the middle of the night. “And then I’d be&nbsp;like, ‘Oh, it’s just John Cena, it’s OK.’”</p><p class=p1>When the costars first met, Robbie was initially wary about revealing her former passions to the former wrestler yet ended up spilling the beans some “five seconds into meeting him.”<span class=s1><br></span></p><p class=p1>After the&nbsp;<i>Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood&nbsp;</i>star told the story, she explained, “Now I know that there’s very little to weird out this guy!”</p><p class=p1>Anderson, 50, then brought out a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> for the action star after hearing about the costars’ history: A cardboard cut-out of <a href=#>Robbie as Harley Quinn</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Margot-Robbie-Had-a-Cardboard-Cutout-of-John-Cena-in-Her-Room-for-Two-Years-Inline.jpg><p class=p3>“You also have to sleep with that in your room for two years,” Robbie jokingly said. “Just to level the playing field,” to which Cena nonchalantly agreed.</p><p class=p1>During the segment, the director, 54, revealed his own history with the&nbsp;<i>Black-ish&nbsp;</i>alum.
