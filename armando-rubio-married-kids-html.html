The first male gay couple featured on the TLC franchise got married at the Mansarda winery in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.
They told People that the difficulty of getting there, because of delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, made the event even more special.  
It was a battle in many ways, and so it’s surreal to finally get married. 
The couple iterated that the lockdown had actually been an advantage for them because it brought them close and gave them more time to plan for the wedding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The two met in a support group for gay fathers where they immediately connected and began their relationship.</p><p>Niedermeier moved from Florida to Mexico to be with Rubio and his daughter Hannah.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The couple had many&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hurdles</a> to overcome, like any other international couple. Not only did Niedermeier not speak a word of&nbsp;Spanish, which created a strain between them, but his husband's native country is also less tolerant of gay relationships than the US.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>At that time, Rubio was still <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">coming</a> out. In contrast to Niedermeier, who had been out since the 1980s.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two sometimes clashed over acceptable PDA, with Niedermeier pushing Rubio&nbsp;occasionally but making sure not to ask too much too soon as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Rubio’s conservative family took some time to come to terms with his coming out, the couple&nbsp;eventually got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engaged</a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Unfortunately, there was another&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">obstacle</a>. The couple was denied a marriage license despite the legalization of same-gender marriages in the country.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The process to repeal the denial included them writing to human rights organizations.&nbsp;Their plea was finally&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&nbsp;finale.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rubio and Niedermeier’s Big Family</h2><p>The couple could not help but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shed</a> happy tears upon receiving the approval, and their joy was felt in equal measure by both their families. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Niedermeier has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">four kids</a>&nbsp;and a grandfather. The TLC star’s son Bricen is 28, while his<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;</a>triplet daughters Taylor, Cassidy, and Madison are 24.</p><p>Fans have always been curious about the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>90 Day Fiancé</a>&nbsp;star’s ex-wife, but Niedermeier&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed</a>&nbsp;that he was never married.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He revealed he had been in two long-term relationships and had&nbsp;faked a marriage with a female friend. He also mentioned that his children were born via in-vitro fertilization.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Rubio’s first marriage is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">genuine</a>. He got married the first time despite knowing he was gay because of the machismo culture in Mexico. He eventually came out to his wife, who was not supportive, and the two ended up filing for divorce.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few months after that, his ex-wife passed away in a tragic&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">car accident</a>.</p><p>Rubio&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has</a>&nbsp;a 6-year-old daughter, Hannah, with his late ex-wife.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkae6orrDqGSrrZKevG65wKupop2UYriqsNJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
