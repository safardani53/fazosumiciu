The British Medical Association (BMA) said the government had failed to make a credible offer to end the long-running wage dispute. Negotiations have been rumbling on for five weeks but the deadline has now passed.
The BMA's junior doctors committee unanimously voted for further walkouts in December and January, in what will be the longest strike in NHS history."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But, as we have seen with previous walkouts, patients will once again pay the price through renewed delays and disruption.</p><p>“We know this walk out will be especially hard for trusts to manage given lots of staff will have annual leave booked over the festive period.</p><p>“Strikes have cost the NHS more than £1.3bn already and more than one million delayed patient appointments. The strikes announced today will only add to the toll.</p><p>“It isn’t too late for the government and unions to sort out this dispute and to prevent more strikes. Trust leaders hope the walkouts will be avoided.”</p><p>Health and Social Care Secretary Victoria Atkins said: <strong>“</strong>It is disappointing that despite significant progress the BMA Junior Doctors Committee have walked away from negotiations and declared new strikes.</p><p>"These will result in more disruption for patients and extra pressure on NHS services and staff as we enter a busy winter period, risking patient safety.</p><p>“I have been clear that I respect the work of doctors in training and want to work with them to settle this dispute.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We have agreed a fair and reasonable offer with the BMA’s Consultants Committee which is being put to members for vote following constructive talks.</p><p>“If the Junior Doctors Committee call off their strikes, we will immediately look to come back to the table to continue negotiations.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzgJhuamlsZWS3trrIqKlmnJ%2BYwbC%2B0maqraqZoLJur8eroKysnZbAbrrEsGSynZGnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
