Carlos King backed up the claims on his podcast,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Reality with the King,</a> as he confirmed that Phaedra will likely be in the upcoming season.</p><p>Phaedra is currently dating a doctor, as she revealed on <a href=#>Ultimate Girls Trip,</a> which is the perfect way for her to make a full-time return to Bravo. However, it is also thought that she has been approached by Real Housewives Of Atlanta.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-spark-fury-as-anila-sajja-fired-from-married-to-medicine>Fans spark fury as Anila Sajja ‘fired’ from Married To Medicine</h2><p>Carlos called Phaedra a “staple&nbsp;in reality television” but he revealed that “in order to afford Phaedra, you have to get rid of some people.” Which likely links into Anila Sajja and Contessa Metcalfe’s alleged departure.</p><p>Carlos then alleges that two people from Married To Medicine won’t return. On the podcast he claims that he was told that one person “doesn’t want to come back” and the other person was “allegedly fired.”</p><p>Contessa joined the gang during season 5 and has now confirmed that she has departed the show ahead of season 10. Anila joined the show in Season 8 but was hooked on the show from the first season, before even joining the cast. Anila has not yet confirmed her departure or alleged ‘firing.’</p><p>However, Contessa has revealed why she is leaving the show, in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive.</a> Metcalfe shares that not only is she fed up with the reality TV sphere but she was upset with how she was portrayed on the show.</p><p>Metcalfe explained: “I decided to quit after last season, I needed a break because it wasn’t highlighting me as a doctor or as a mom…Plus it’s been 5 years! I’m sick of cussing and crying.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=contessa-says-anila-isnt-a-good-fit-for-married-to-medicine>Contessa says Anila isn’t a ‘good fit’ for Married To Medicine</h2><p>Metcalfe admitted that she doesn’t speak with Anila Sajja outside of the show. But she didn’t think Anila “was a good fit anyway.”</p><p>However, when asked about Phaedra joining the cast, Contessa seemed to think she would be perfect for the show. Contessa explained: “I think Phaedra – who’s my neighbor – is going to be a fun addition.”</p><p>If Carlos claims that one person doesn’t want to come back and another was allegedly fired. This suggests that if Contessa didn’t want to return, then Anila could be the co-star who was allegedly fired.</p><p>However, neither Bravo nor Anila has confirmed the departure.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Contessa Metcalfe MD, MSPH (@drcontessa)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p><strong>Reality Titbit has reached out to Anila and Bravo’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfl7%2Biws5onZqmo2LAsa3RpGSfraKueqK%2FjJqloqSRYsCitsmaZKCdpKh6p7XRnptmnqKkum65wKupop2UYsGwecyem6KbmaOy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
