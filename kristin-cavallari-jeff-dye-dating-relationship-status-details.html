He reached out to her via DM on Instagram and she replied. It’s only developed into something more as of recent,” an insider spilled to&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY. “They’re dating, but it’s pretty casual right now,” they confirmed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jeff, who appeared NBC’s Last Comic Standing, is a big departure from her NFL star ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a>, 37 — and our source says Kristin is loving the change! “She loves [Jeff’s] comedic structure because she has a really dry sense of humor and so does Jeff. Jay is the total opposite of Jeff,” our source explained, noting that her kids <strong>Camden</strong>, 8, <strong>Jaxon</strong>, 6, and<strong> Saylor</strong>, 4, are her top priority. “She’s taking things very slow because of the kids and the divorce. She doesn’t want to jeopardize her kids understanding of everything because they’re so young and what exactly this means to them, but she likes spending time with him,” the source tells HL.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kristin and Jay married in June 2013 after several years of dating, but sadly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a> in April 2020.&nbsp;“Her relationship has really been done with Jay for 2 years now and she kept what was happening very private as she tried to figure out if she could make things work with him for the sake of the kids but she couldn’t,” the insider added. “She contemplated it for quite some time. Kristin really did try but she felt like Jay just wasn’t putting in the effort she deserved,” they concluded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Since the split, which the couple both confirmed via statements on Instagram, the Uncommon James has revealed she’s actively trying to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>drop Jay’s last name</a>. “Technically I’m still Cutler. [I’m] working on that, but I’m literally going to take a note right now to change it,” she said to radio host <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong> as she held up a piece of paper with her legal married name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe5BxZqSqmajBqrqMnJivmZyhrrO1jKOcn55dmcamecOaq6Kml2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF50q2Yra2jYrGmwMCio6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
