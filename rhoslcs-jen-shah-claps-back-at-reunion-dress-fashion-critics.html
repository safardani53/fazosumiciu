The “WAP” singer previously wore the number to the American Music Awards in November 2021.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Despite Shah setting the record straight, Twitter continued to have memes pouring through. “Jen Shah as Theodore Pauley,” one user wrote, referencing the purple creature from Monster’s Inc. “I just can’t unsee it looking at her dress now.” Another commented that the outfit was “terrible.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Yzma-Emperors-New-Groove.jpg><p class=p1>While Shah’s outfit took center stage, she wasn’t the only one to face critics. Bravo fans were less than pleased with the ladies’ looks across the board. After the reunion show outfits were released, fans flooded the comments section on the Bravo by Betches Instagram account.</p><p class=p1>“Why do they all look like they went shopping at a bad prom dress store?” one user asked, while another quipped, “More stylists need to move to Utah.” Someone else chimed in: “Nope nope nope.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Meredith Marks</strong></a>‘ Christian Cowan dress also sparked a handful of comparisons, with fans saying she resembled everything from a “nurse in Elton John’s hospital” to “muppet.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Whitney Wild Rose</strong></a>, for her part, wore a velvet green gown from Liastublla that seemed to be the fan favorite. <a href=#><strong>Heather Gay</strong></a> arrived in a navy velvet dress, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Barlow</strong></a> rocked a metallic purple number and Jennie Nguyen wore a glitzy purple number.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While <a href=#><strong>Mary Cosby</strong></a>’s outfit would likely have been one for the books, the reality star did not attend the reunion. “As you’ve heard, Mary M. Cosby did not come, which was very disappointing to me,” <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> said during a January broadcast of his SiriusXM radio show. <span class=s1>“I spoke to her on New Year’s Eve a few hours before I went on the air. We had a long talk, and it’s her story to tell, but I got the sense that she was not finding gratitude in being on the show anymore.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e1sL%2FLnKpmopWjerS0wKFknKSRpcBursCcomaZpGK%2FpsHNoqanZZSnsrS%2FjJ%2BYrKCZpLtur9Giq6Kbo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
