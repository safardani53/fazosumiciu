At the time, Emily reveals that although she and Fabolous have a child and they’ve lived together for some time,&nbsp;he only treated her as his employee. Emily, who was his stylist at the time, admits that they were together for eight years at that point and they ever went public with their romance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the clip, Emily continues to tell her friend, Mashonda that Fabolous had never mentioned to anyone that he had a girlfriend, and that people would question who he had a child with. Emily later questions if she should take a break from the rapper, however, she’s conflicted because she doesn’t want to give up on her family. The clip ends with Emily in tears over her relationship with Fabolous.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As you may know, Fabolous and Emily’s relationship did not end after that 2011 clip. The pair, although they’ve had major ups and downs, continued their romance, and now have two sons together —<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Jonas,</strong> 2, and <strong>Johan</strong>, 10.
