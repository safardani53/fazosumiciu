As of this writing, the couple has officially been together for a year. So, to mark the occasion, here is a look at some of their cute moments on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christopher Briney and Isabela Machado’s first post featuring each other</h2><p>As per Briney and Machado’s official online resumes, the two attended Pace University, majoring in Acting For Film, Television, Voice Over, and Commercial. So, it’s highly likely that they met there for the first time.</p><p>After bumping into each other, they initially became friends for several years before taking further steps in their relationship. On March 8, 2018, the actor took to his Instagram handle to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/BgDPEF0H8XB/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">feature</a> his now-girlfriend and his other friend Dan Kulesza.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Isabela-Machado-Dan-Kulesza.webp><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Christopher Briney’s now-girlfriend, Isabela Machado, with their best friend, Dan Kulesza (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>A couple of months later, on May 11, Machado featured Briney on her Instagram handle. She had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a picture taken in Lower Manhattan in which she was with her friend, Lucy, and Briney was walking behind them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They go hard on Earth</h2><p>Briney and Machado started as friends, and there was a whole group with whom the couple spent a lot of time. On May 7, 2018, the actor posted a picture with some friends, including Machado.</p><p>Besides Briney and Machado, the two other people in the picture were Dan Kulesza and Olivia Yount. “We go hard on earth,” Briney had captioned his post.</p><p>Over two months later, on July 21, Machado <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> a picture in which she was with her now-boyfriend and Yount. The photo was taken at Lake Gaston, North Carolina, and it was captioned, “6 days but who’s counting.” It seems they were on vacation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The drunk gang of four</h2><p>During their acting school days, Briney and Machado had a lot of fun with their friends. And Briney’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> of October 28, 2018, shows that they occasionally got a bit tipsy as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/christopher-briney-taking-pictures-girlfriend-isabel-machado.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Christopher Briney taking pictures of his girlfriend Isabel Machado (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>The actor had posted a picture in which he was seen alongside Machado, Kulesza, and Yount. All of their expressions and t-shirts with “Drunk” written over them hinted that they were down a couple of bottles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A February filled with fun</h2><p>On March 2, 2019, Briney <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> multiple snaps captured over different days of February alongside his girlfriend and his other friends. Keeping the caption simple, he wrote, “February fun.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christopher Briney and Isabela Machado love acting school</h2><p>On May 12, 2019, Machado took to her Instagram handle to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">share</a> a picture of herself and her boyfriend sitting in front of each other. “I &lt;3 Acting school,” she captioned her post.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The picture was still taken from a play from their acting school in which the two had taken part. It was titled Reasons To Be Pretty and was directed by Anthony Arkin. Briney and Machado were playing the roles of lovers named Gregory and Stephanie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The four horsemen of best friends</h2><p>By now, it’s evident that Briney and Machado have a strong bond with their best friends, particularly Kulesza and Yount. On May 17, 2020, the actor expressed how thankful he is to have them by his side.</p><p>He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> multiple pictures taken over the years alongside Machado, Kulesza, and Yount and wrote, “the best friends a guy could ask for. 18J forever.” At the time, Briney and Machado were yet to start dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The kiss at the lake</h2><p>In late February 2022, Briney, Machado, and their friends visited one of their go-to places — Lake Gaston. And when Machado shared pictures from that trip on February 23, 2022, we got to see her and Briney kissing each other for the first time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Most recently, on May 9, the couple once again visited Lake Gaston, where they again shared a kiss. While captioning the second picture, she said she was so glad they kissed. “I never want it any other way,” Briney commented under the post.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The big premiere in New York City</h2><p>Briney and Machado recently hit the red carpet together while attending the premiere of Amazon Prime’s The Summer I Turned Pretty in New York City.</p><p>The actor <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce7HipmudMZ/?hl=en" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> a couple of snaps from the memorable event on June 18, 2022, and one of them was with his partner. Similarly, the couple’s best friends also attended Briney’s big event.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>One year of togetherness</h2><p>On Friday, June 24, 2022, Briney took to his Instagram handle to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfKM1Ayuvzs/?hl=en" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> a picture and a short clip taken alongside Machado. The actor had posted them to mark his first dating anniversary with his girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Christopher-Briney-girlfriend-Isabela-Machado.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Christopher Briney with his girlfriend Isabela Machado at the premiere of The Summer I Turned Pretty (Photo: Getty / Craig Barritt)</p><p>“A whole year!? I could never want anything else,” he captioned his post. Going by all that, it could easily be said that Briney and Machado have bonded excellently over the years, with their togetherness starting as friends and eventually turning into a romance.</p><p>Both of them have supported and held each other hands during their rough times. Besides, during his <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.glamour.com/story/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-christopher-briney rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Glamour Magazine</a>, the actor mentioned that at one point in filming The Summer I Turned Pretty, he got to know that his partner had a bad day.</p><p>To cheer her up, he sent flowers and a teddy bear from North Carolina through a mail service. And though he did acknowledge that it might not be the most incredible thing, he was proud of himself for making that happen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A hug in July</h2><p>On July 4, 2022, Machado took to her Instagram handle to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CfmNRnmOZK0/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">share</a> a series of pictures and captioned it by writing, “squishmallows r for lovers &lt;3.” In the third slide, we saw the romantic couple hugging as Briney took a mirror selfie of it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The fifth slide also showed a cropped part of the picture in the third slide. In the middle of the third and fifth slides was a red cloth in which a heartfelt line was written in a silver color, probably summing Machado’s failure in love before she found Briney.</p><p>Some lines from the cloth read, “Entering your first healthy relationship after unhealthy ones isn’t easy. You have to relearn what love looks like. You might feel it’s too good to be true, experience invasive thoughts or self sabotage.”</p><p>Later, on July 19, she once again featured her boyfriend, and they were having an intimate moment. She posted a picture in which Briney was delivering a soft kiss on Machado’s neck, with the latter blushing all over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christopher’s favorites</h2><p>October and November 2022 were other months when fans witnessed more cute moments of the couple on Instagram. Firstly, on October 16, 2022, Briney <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CjwIN61ust7/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a series of pictures of his partner from one of her photoshoots. “isabel &lt;3,” he captioned his post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/christopher-briney-kissing-girlfriend-isabel-machado.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Christopher Briney kissing his girlfriend Isabel Machado (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Over a fortnight later, on November 4, 2022, Machado shared some photos of herself from her photoshoot with photographer Klara Waldberg. In the caption, she mentioned that these images were some of Briney’s favorites.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A December filled with love</h2><p>December 2022 was the time when Briney spent some time with Machado’s family. And Machado shared some glimpses of it via her Instagram handle on December 2. And her post on December 7 showed the love birds spending quality time with each other and sharing a kiss.</p><p>10 days later, on December 17, Briney did what Machado did in November by sharing some pictures from his photoshoot, and the pictures he posted were Machado’s favorites which he clearly stated in his caption.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Another year down, yet the love remains the same</h2><p>December 2022 passed and January 2023 walked in! And although it was a new year, the love and affection Briney and Machado had for each other remained the same. And all of that was also witnessed via their respective Instagram handles.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Machado opened up her January 2023 by sharing some black and white pictures of Briney kissing her on the lips. She captioned her post in Spanish by writing, “bésame,” which meant “Kiss me” in English. And Briney replied to her caption in the caption by saying, “Always.”</p><p>Briney featured his girlfriend for the first time in 2023 on January 25, when he shared a series of pictures of his closest friends in his life. And among the three pictures, the first one was of Machado.</p><p>February 2023 showed the duo a little less than usual, but Machado made sure fans knew she and Briney were still together by flaunting pictures that were clicked by her boyfriend – with Briney still in the frame as he took her pictures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>March 2023 gave a glimpse of the life partners enjoying their time in California, April showed them attending a Frank Ocean concert at Coachella, and in May, the two <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsjaABUOWBM/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enjoyed</a> their time together at Sandals Grenada Resort & Spa.</p><p>Since then, neither Briney nor Machado has featured each other on their respective social media handles, particularly Instagram. Nonetheless, it’s sure that they have been quietly relishing their time and will share another cute moment whenever they feel necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZpygop7AtbvPoZyrZZKntq%2Bx2Gaeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZKKrkZeyrXnMmpqhmZSkfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
