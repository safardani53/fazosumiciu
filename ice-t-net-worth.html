Hip-hop would not be what it is today had pioneers like Ice-T not led the way. On Tuesday, June 28, A&E’s latest docuseries — Origins of Hip-Hop — details the “99 Problems” rapper’s rise to fame.
Although he made his debut in the industry as a recording artist, he’s also acquired a long list of television and film credits over the course of his decades-long career in entertainment."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But the rapper came from humble beginnings.</p><p>Born Tracy Lauren Marrow, Ice-T hails from Newark, N.J. His mother died of a heart attack when he was only 3 years old. His father faced the same tragic fate when Ice-T was 13. Following his dad’s death, the one-day rapper was forced to uproot his life and move to Los Angeles.

Years later, the rapper found himself at the center of controversy after he released “Cop Killer.”</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Ice-T</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">American rapper, Actor</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $65 million</p><p>Ice-T pioneered the art of gangsta rap after he dropped his debut album, Rhyme Pays. Years later, the rapper sparked debate after the release of his controversial rap song "Cop Killer." The entertainer made his film debut in New Jack City and later Ricochet in the early 1990s. He's best known for his role as Finn Tutuola on Dick Wolf's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>February 16, 1968</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Newark, N.J.</p><p><strong>Birth name: </strong>Tracy Lauren Marrow</p><p><strong>Father:</strong> Soloman Marrow</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Alice Marrow</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Chanel Nicole Marrow, Letesha Marrow, Tracy Marrow Jr.</p><p><strong>Marriages: </strong>Coco Austin (m. 2002)</p><p>Since then, he’s been named as one of the founding fathers of gangsta rap. However, he’s also made his mark on the small screen. At the start of the millennium, he joined the cast of <a href=#>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a> alongside co-stars Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni.

In an interview with <a href=#>Distractify</a>, Ice-T assured fans that he isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p><p>“I'm trying to stay on the show until they decide it's over.

You don't find that much in Hollywood. And I really enjoy that now. So, I'm not planning on leaving,” he said of SVU.</p><p>And the long-running series isn’t the only opportunity he’s had to show off his acting chops. Among other films, Ice-T starred in New Jack City alongside Wesley Snipes in 1991 and appeared in Richochet with Denzel Washington the same year.</p><p>Ice-T’s episode of Origins of Hip-Hop is available for streaming on the A&E app and aetv.com now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrCmedNmpZ6sXay8s8DH</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
