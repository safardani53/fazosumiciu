“Since Lindsay’s been drinking, I’ve been struggling to navigate it,” Carl, 38, confessed to the cameras during the Monday, April 24, episode of Summer House. “I know what it’s like to have seven or eight drinks and then something kind of gets twisted and you get angry or you get upset."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Fans saw Lindsay and Danielle’s friendship start to<a href=#> fall apart at the beginning of season 7 of Summer House</a>, which filmed in summer 2022.)</p><p>“She told me she doesn’t have an issue with <a href=#>me and you and our relationship</a>,” Carl told Lindsay, revealing that despite Danielle’s past reservations about their romance she was supportive of them moving forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Summer-House-Recap-Carl-Confesses-He-s-Struggling-to-Navigate-Lindsay-s-Drinking-Amid-Danielle-Drama-253.jpg><p>The Hubb House PR founder, however, didn’t believe her then-boyfriend about how well his conversation with Danielle went. “She doesn’t have an issue with you,” Lindsay said, claiming her partner didn’t have her back. “You don’t give a f—k that she has an issue with me. <a href=#>The entire thing is blamed on me</a>.”</p><p>The Florida native, who had been out drinking with some of their housemates earlier that evening, alleged that Carl didn’t “care about” her since <a href=#>she hadn’t fixed her drama with Danielle</a>.</p><p>“You’re putting me in a position where no matter what I say, I’m wrong. I don’t want to keep going down this,” Carl, <a href=#>who proposed to Lindsay in August 2022</a>, said during the episode while lying in bed. “You’re just being rude. You came in the door and were looking for a fight.”</p><p>Lindsay insisted that her partner wasn’t in her corner. “I’m asking you to be a f—king partner to me. I want my boyfriend to be like, ‘You were a f—king piece of s—t to my girlfriend, <a href=#>go apologize now</a>,’” she confessed.</p><p>After the publicist claimed that <a href=#>Carl “did not help” her feel better</a> he quipped, “Yep, I’m a horrible person. I f—ked it all up.” Lindsay didn’t correct him, instead she fired back: “You always love a f—king a pity party. Has it ever occurred to you that I have f—king feelings?”</p><p>Ahead of <a href=#>filming season 7 of Summer House</a>, Lindsay temporarily went sober to help Carl navigate his own sobriety journey. She <a href=#>started drinking in summer 2022</a> after forgoing alcohol from late 2021 to spring of 2022.</p><p>Despite their tension on screen over Lindsay’s alcohol consumption, Carl <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in February that it is “amazing” to have a partner who is “understanding and accommodating and supportive” of his own journey.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve always wanted her to do what’s best for her and honestly, her having a glass of wine with her aunt or having a Loverboy with whoever, I fully support that,” <a href=#>he told Us of his fiancée’s choice to drink on occasion</a>. “I think it’s all about communication and understanding, you know, what works for each other and it’s a constant conversation.”</p><p>Summer House airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqupZ2av260zq6qnqtdmK6zuIyiqmarpKfCqLPLoqWgZaSkeq%2Bt1aKemqyVYrmqusOsmLKrXZm%2FqrrKoqWgZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
