He was 96.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reps for the musician confirmed in a press release that Belafonte died Tuesday morning "of congestive heart failure at his New York home at the age of 96, his wife Pamela [Frank] by his side."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, the "Jump in the Line" performer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Early Influence category.

"She took us there because it was easier to raise a child in the village than it was on the streets of New York."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Belafonte.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bettmann Archive</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After a brief stint in the Navy, he befriended Paul Robeson, who would go on to become his mentor, and began his recording career in 1949 after working his way through the New York City club scene.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he began as a jazz act, and then a pop singer, he'd started performing folk music by 1950, and soon, his star was on the rise, according to a 1996 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New Yorker</a> article.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the release of his first album in 1954, Belafonte expanded his talents to the silver screen, breaking racial barriers in critically acclaimed hits like Carmen Jones, which co-starred Dorothy Dandridge. He also won a Tony Award for his performance in the Broadway musical Almanac.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo by Hollywood Photo Archive/Mediapunch/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though his marriage to first wife Margurite crumbled around that time ("I just found the show-biz world to be shallow, and false," she told the New Yorker), Belafonte was on the cusp of a breakthrough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1956, he released Calypso, which topped the Billboard charts and sold more than 1 million copies, earning him the nickname "King of Calypso."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The album contained timeless hits such as "Day-O (Banana Boat Song)," a traditional Jamaican folk song that would go on to become Belafonte's signature track. Belafonte's version was inducted into the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Grammy Hall of Fame</a> in 2009.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Belafonte told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Library of Congress</a> that he received pushback from "everybody" at the time for wanting to record an album of calypso songs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They thought me doing it was an affront to the many great calypso artists," he said. "That I was invading somehow. But I had this history in my back pocket. I had grown up in the Caribbean and in Jamaica and I thought it was a good idea... Well, the authorities at RCA didn't. They said it would have no audience. It was just not a recognized genre in that day."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Belafonte, then and now.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Archive Photos/Getty; Taylor Hill/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of "Day-O," Belafonte said that he believes the song's enduring popularity comes from the contagiousness of its melody.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I always invited participation when I performed it and the audience always happily jumped in," he said. "It became a regular part of my routine. Even on the street, I would see people and they'd yell, 'Hey, 'Day-O'!' I took it as a badge of honor."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to his music successes, Belafonte also carried on his screen career, winning an Emmy in 1960 for outstanding performance in a variety or musical program for The Revlon Revue: Tonight With Belafonte. The honor made him the first Black person to win an Emmy, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. It was around that time that Belafonte's popularity soared, with Look magazine declaring him "one of the most acclaimed entertainers in America today, [and] the first Negro matinée idol in our entertainment history," according to the New Yorker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Belafonte was also known for his activism, and had advocated over the years for civil rights and other political and humanitarian causes, such as the Anti-Apartheid Movement and USA for Africa. In 1968, he became the first Black person to host a late-night TV show when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>assumed hosting duties</a> on The Tonight Show amid national civil rights protests, welcoming guests like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Belafonte.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bettmann Archive</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When Dr. King called me in the first instance, I think he reached out for me because he needed to reach out to a much broader constituency than he had been serving," Belafonte <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>once said of his first meeting</a> with the then-24-year-old King. "He said, 'You know, I don't know all that will be... I don't know where this goes. All I do know is that I am compelled to go with it... At the end I told him, 'I make the commitment, I'm in. I have no idea where this will go either, but I will stay the course no matter what."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">King's assassination in 1968 rendered Belafonte "immobile — physically and emotionally and psychologically," he told The Scotsman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The accolades accumulated by Belafonte over the years are endless; he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1987, and received a National Medal of the Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1994. In 2000, he was honored with the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and two years later, he received the Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award for his efforts to assist Africa from Africare. He's been recognized by everyone from the NAACP and ACLU, to the Peace Corps and the Boy Scouts of America. He has been involved in advocacy for prostate cancer since 2006, when he was diagnosed with and eventually beat the disease. Additionally, the American Association of Retired People (AARP) named Belafonte one of nine recipients of the 2006 Impact Award.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One of my father's songs has a line about 'A secret soldier with pieces inside broke,' and that's how I see him," his daughter Adrienne told the New Yorker in 1996. "He wants to fix the world, and he's sad because he sees it slipping away. I believe he feels alone."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Belafonte.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mondadori via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Belafonte has also received honorary degrees from several higher learning institutions, including Spelman College, City University of New York, Tufts University, Brandeis University, Long Island University, Bard College, and Columbia University, from which he received a Doctor of Humane Letters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This last period of my life is absolutely fascinating to me," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a> in 2017. "I'm like, I'm outside, looking at a story, and I have no idea what's on the next page — none."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He married his third wife, photographer Pamela Frank, in 2008, and is survived by children Adrienne Belafonte Biesemeyer, Shari Belafonte, David Belafonte and Gina Belafonte as well as two stepchildren Sarah Frank and Lindsey Frank.
