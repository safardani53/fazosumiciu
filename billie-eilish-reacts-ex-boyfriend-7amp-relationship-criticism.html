I don’t think you should be in a relationship super excited about things that the other person couldn’t care less about,” Billie said while reflecting on their romance. She continued, “I don’t think that’s fair to you. I don’t think that’s fair to him. There was just a lack of effort. I was literally like, ‘Dude, you don’t have enough love to love yourself so you can’t love me, dude. And you don’t…[Billie laughed]…You think you do.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I do love him though, which made it harder,” Billie continued. “I’m not over him, I didn’t find someone else. I didn’t stop having love for him. I just spent time away from him for a little bit and I was like, ‘Wow I’m missing so much because I’m worried about you all the time and I don’t want what you want and you don’t want what I want.’ I don’t want to fix him. I can’t fix him. I tried.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49uZpuhnKG2pnnEoqOiq5hiv6atwq2qZp2oYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGKEornPZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWTp7a1tcKiqqZn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
