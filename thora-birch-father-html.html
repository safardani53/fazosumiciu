However, his behavior on the set was intrusive.</p><p>During one rehearsal, he had been spotted peering through one of the set’s windows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><img alt="Thora Birch sharing about her early acting roles with Great Big Story" height=555 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Thora-Birch-.jpg width=658 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><strong>Thora Birch sharing about her early acting roles with Great Big Story</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“It really was like ‘Nightmare on Elm Street,’” Alexander said. “It was bizarre. He also insisted on hanging out in the girls’ dressing room. And all the girls are in it. Including people besides his daughter!”</p><p>Jack said he was examining “a loose, very wobbly platform that Thora and others had to walk through” when his actions were misunderstood as him peering through the window.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Thora was replaced by her understudy. As for losing her role in Dracula, she said she was in a state of shock and found it hard to believe. She also noted that her father was her best supporter.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Thora Birch and Parents</h2><p>Thora was born to her parents, Jack Birch and Carol Connors, on March 11, 1982, in Los Angeles, California.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Both of her parents were adult film actors throughout the 1970s and met on the set of 1972 adult film Deep Throat. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By the time Thora was born, her parents had already moved away from doing adult films. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During one of her appearances on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WTF with Marc Maron</a>, the actress revealed her parents were fairly conservative, but not “in the religious sense.”</p><p>She shared they were very strict, health-conscious, and wouldn’t let her watch much TV. However, they let her babysitter take her to auditions for commercials.</p><p>And that was also how Thora got started with her career by appearing in advertisements when she was just four years old.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Thora has since appeared in dozens of movies. More recently, she starred in projects such as <a href=# rel=follow>The Walking Dead</a> (2019-2020), and 13 Minutes (2021).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyYpL%2BiecGiqZygXZuutbTEq2WhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
