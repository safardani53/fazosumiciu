Men often compare the length of their shaft against “the average” to see whether their own is on the smaller or larger end of the scale. 
The NHS says most men's penises are somewhere around 9cm (3.75in) long when flacid, and between 13cm to 18cm (5in to 7in) when erect

but any bigger and the orgasm rates drop.</p><p>In fact, men with a whopping 11-inch member got 30 per cent of women to reach climax, which is the same proportion for men with a four inch penis.</p><p><a href=#>Another study </a>asked what size women prefer in a relationship compared with a one-night stand.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Researchers found that the average length women preferred for a long-term relationship was 6.3 inches, but for one-night stands, women opted for slightly bigger penises, with a length of 6.4 inches.</p><p>Experts say when it comes to great sex, size doesn't matter -
