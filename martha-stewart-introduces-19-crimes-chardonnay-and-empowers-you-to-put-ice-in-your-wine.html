It's something Stewart says took about 20 iterations to get right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have very strong ideas about what a Chardonnay should be," she tells PEOPLE exclusively. "I have not really been a big fan of the oaky, overly buttery Chardonnays that exist. I thought Chardonnay in America needed a little bit of a redesign."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So that's what we were attempting to do — a kind of redesign and to simplify and make a very palatable white wine that would sell like crazy," she adds.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>19 Crimes</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Martha's Chard is available in California now and will be sold nationwide on Feb. 1 for $11.99.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more on Martha Stewart, listen below to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day</a>.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before going to market, Stewart tested the vino on close confidants and even took a case to the Dominican Republic on vacation to serve to friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The big majority of the people who tested the wine agreed with me. They chose my version, the final version, over the 19 Crimes version. So I was really pleased," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stewart, 80, is "not a big drinker," she says. "I never have been." She'll have a glass of wine or two with dinner and has a trick to keep herself from going overboard that was long considered a wine faux pas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I will put ice in my wine," Stewart explains. "I extend the glass quite a bit by the addition of ice cubes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nobody minds it anymore, even fine winemakers," the etiquette expert says. "I met the man who makes the best Sauterne, and he encouraged me to add ice to it! He said, 'It's fine. Don't worry about it, Martha. We're not going to get insulted. We know the taste is there. The flavor is there. The fineness is there. You can add ice to it, of course.' So, that's how I extend a glass of wine. But, I like to serve my beautiful Martha's Chard icy cold."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>19 Crimes</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for</strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong> </strong><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">19 Crimes also partners with Snoop Dogg, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Stewart's friend </a>and cohost of Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party, so he was "absolutely" a big part of getting Stewart on board with the brand, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They went to him first to do his Cali Red. Then they did his Cali Rosé. It was so popular!" says Stewart. "That was one of the biggest launches ever in the wine industry.
