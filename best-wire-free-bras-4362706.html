This attitude reflects in her <a href=#>lingerie choices</a>, too. She has sported many wire-free bras that allow her to move and live in the moment, all while looking stylish while doing it, whether she’s doing a workout (hence the sporty green bralette above) or dancing at a festival (i.e. the sheer lace bralette she once wore to Coachella below).<p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Kendall Jenner wore a wire-free, black floral lace bralette to Coachella in 2016. We listed a similar bra below!

This bra will keep your ta ta’s in place as you do light cardiovascular activity, like a yoga session or walk down the street to grab a smoothie. Alo Yoga is especially famous for its&nbsp;super&nbsp;soft fabric, so it won’t feel like your bosom is suffocating underneath the secure bra — which, unfortunately, is an issue with many sports bras. Pair this with Alo Yoga’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>High-Waist Alosoft Highlight Legging</a> in the same “honeydew” color to complete the look.&nbsp;$54, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>aloyoga.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/aloyoga.jpeg alt="aloyoga bra" width=293 height=440 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>2.&nbsp;<span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Savage x Fenty’s Floral Lace Racerback Bralette&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>To recreate Kendall’s 2016 Coachella look pictured above, we of course had to turn to the No. 1 carrier for the cutest lace lingerie pieces: <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savage x Fenty</a>. This bralette from Rihanna’s famous undergarments bra is worn like a halter top and even comes with adjustable elastic straps. It’s comfort and sex appeal, combined into one! This bra is also available in six other seductive colors: grey pearl, honey nude, pink rose quartz, unicorn lavender pink, deep periwinkle blue and navy blue. $40, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>savagexfenty.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-6.23.46-PM.png alt="black lace floral bra" width=394 height=447 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>3. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Warner’s Women’s Easy Does It No Bulge Wire-Free Bra</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>For our no-fuss shoppers who just want a bra to disappear underneath their white tee — no frills, no lace — this is the bra for you. This nude-toned bra won’t clash with your sheer tops and is designed with comfort in mind, being made of 94 percent nylon and six percent spandex. Plus, look how smooth the bra is: no bulging cups, wires or other details that would annoyingly poke through a shirt! $20, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-6.26.00-PM.png alt="nude wire-free bra" width=387 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>4. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Bali Women’s Double Support Wirefree Bra</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Going wire-free doesn’t mean you&nbsp;have&nbsp;to sacrifice sexiness, though. This bra’s white satin and dainty lace detailing — all topped off by a classic ribbon — will make you feel like you just slipped into The Bachelor‘s Fantasy Suite (or, your honeymoon suite). Don’t let the cute aesthetics fool you: this is a heavy-duty bra that accommodates sizes between 34B to 48DD.&nbsp;$15, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-6.30.01-PM.png alt="satin wire-free bra" width=367 height=486 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>5. Hanes Women’s Cozy Bra</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Think of this as the sweatpants version of a bra! If you’re looking for ULTIMATE comfort — meaning not even clasp hooks or spaghetti straps with a tendency to fall down your shoulders — this bra was designed for you. This bra is made of “cool comfort wicking” fabric and features a “Comfort Flex Fit” that contours to your natural body shape. It’s the perfect bra for a day of running errands, or for enjoying wine on a cozy night-in with your friends. $10, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>target.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-17><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-6.34.35-PM.png alt="hanes wire-free bra" width=366 height=406 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>6.&nbsp;<span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Just My Size Women’s Pure Comfort Lace Plus Size Bra</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Not all wire-free bras are itty-bitty lace bralettes. Case in point: this plus-size bra from Just My Size, which has nearly 1,400 reviews on Amazon. The bra — which features a lovely floral embellishment along the front — runs in sizes X-Large to 1X.

No stiff or itchy fabric here!&nbsp;$12, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-19><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-31-at-6.50.16-PM.png alt="plus size wire-free bra" width=351 height=468 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>7. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Bali Women’s Comfort Revolution Shaping Wire-Free Bra</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>For a wire-free bra with the shape and support that a sports bra offers (but doesn’t feel like a boa constrictor across your bosom), we’re excited to show you this beloved bra on Amazon. This U-design bra made of 79 percent nylon, 16 percent polyester and five percent spandex fits like a glove and is kept in place with a hook and eye closure. This is a seriously comfortable bra, according to the many Amazon reviews (there were nearly 12,000 total).</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“This is the first time I have used the word ‘comfortable’ to describe a bra, AND it looks fine under a fitted top,” one customer wrote, and another shopper even called the bra “life changing” because it was the most “comfortable bra [they’ve] ever worn!” This bra comes in a wide range of sizes, too, from X-Small to 3X-Large. $27, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-22><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-7.48.10-PM.png alt="black wireless bra" width=468 height=516 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>8. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">BRABIC Floral Lace Bra&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-23>Think you have to choose between cute and comfortable when picking out bras? Well, you can have the best of both worlds. This bralette has NO wires and a LOT of lace, making it the perfect companion with a loose tank top that’ll allow you to show off this bra’s delicate floral mesh. This is ideal for cups A-C.&nbsp;$14, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-24><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-7.49.37-PM.png alt="wireless bra" width=374 height=477 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h2>9. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">4 Pieces V Neck Bralettes</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-25>Wear these to the gym, under a sheer top, or with a pair of high-waisted baggy jeans. It’s always a good idea to have a set of neutral-toned bralettes in your wardrobe for an emergency layering situation (or just when you need to throw together a simple yet chic outfit). The straps on these wireless bras are adjustable, too, so you won’t have to deal with spaghetti straps falling down your shoulders. This is an amazing deal — you get four bras for under $30!&nbsp;$23, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-26><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-16-at-8.00.45-PM.png alt="wireless bras" width=320 height=419 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGiqoaegZK%2Bmv9NmrqKqlWKzs7HEZpmrmaNigXSCkXBnb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
