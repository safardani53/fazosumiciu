The 34-year-old singer just proved that when she debuted a new neon green hair color on Instagram.
Grimes got her hair done by celebrity hairstylist Kacey Welch, who gave Grimes a custom neon, fairy look using Welch’s line of premium Silk Weft extensions. Grimes posted the selfie of her new hair with the caption, “I have annexed the mushroom kingdom."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The bangs were shorter in the front and longer on the sides, and in the photo, she had super thin eyebrows with large, glossy brown lips. She styled her glam with a red velvet plunging corset top, a lace ruffled neck collar, and ripped-up knit sleeves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/grimes-hair-makeover-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Grimes has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>changed her appearance</a> quite a lot over the years and back on August 15, 2022, she wrote, “2 years ago I made an appt with a great plastic surgeon, thought I might want to change things up by my mid 30s, but then I forgot and never thought about what I should do. Any face mods y’all think would look good on me? (Elf ears isn’t an option, that’s a separate quest).” After <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posting that</a>, just a month later, in September 2022, she posted a photo of her face <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>covered in bandages</a> with the caption, “I did smthn crazy!” While she did not reveal what procedures she went through, she did post a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of her face</a> a few days later, and it looked much different, as she posted a selfie with much fuller lips and fuller cheeks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49wZqCqmaKytHnNnqanZZensqa6jKGYoqpdoq6ssc6vnKtloJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
