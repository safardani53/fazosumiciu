After playing one more season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tom&nbsp;announced <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his retirement “for good”</a> on February 1, 2023. However, the back-and-forth with his career caused damage to his marriage with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong></a>, 43, who <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorced the athlete</a> in October 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Gisele told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a> in March that the<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> rumors about their split</a> regarding Tom’s decision to un-retire were “very hurtful.” The Brazilian model, who has <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two children</a> with Tom, called the accusations that his retirement recall was the driving factor in their divorce “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.” She also noted that sometimes people “grow apart,” and said <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the split</a> from her husband of 13 years was “heartbreaking.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Since his divorce, Tom has moved on with Russian model&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Irina Shayk</strong></a>, 37, who used to date <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a>. News of the pair’s relationship broke on July 24 when photos surfaced of them <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packing on the PDA</a> outside his home in Los Angeles. The two reportedly spent the night together. A couple of days later, Tom and Irina <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>secretly met up</a> at a sushi restaurant in New York City and an eyewitness told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>&nbsp;that the two stars were “in their own little world” on their dinner date. Most recently, Tom and Irina were <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen leaving the same hotel</a> in London within a 24 hour period on Aug. 14 and Aug. 15.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Tom has not publicly addressed his new romance with Irina. After they first hung out, Gisele <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hinted at how she feels about her ex moving on</a> in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue Brasil</a>. “Breakups are never easy,” she said on Aug. 9, “especially when there’s [media] speculating every step of the way.” Gisele also said that she’s focused on her children, her health, and her projects in the wake of her divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5FqZq2nnWKvs63DsmSsoJmnwa2x0qxkrJ2cm7amecmoop6rXaOzrXnRnquuqp5ivam706hm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
