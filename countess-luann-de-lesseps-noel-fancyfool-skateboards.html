That was the motivation Noel needed to start up FancyFool. “I wanted to do something that I could do with my creative side and not such an active side of it,” he explains.
In 2008, Noel began brainstorming how he could continue his dedication to skateboarding without actively participating in the sport."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I came up with something that had uniqueness to the name — something that represented part of my personality.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Noel has gained much success for his age, he says its hard trying to find people who will treat him like an adult. “The tough part is people taking me seriously, but once they see the stuff I’ve been working on, the skateboards and how they look and how they perform, then it opens up to be a more serious look on it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>However, Noel is in no rush to enter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adulthood</a>. “It’s more about personal awareness of how far you can push your limits.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Furthermore, he hopes to inspire young entrepreneurs and creative minds to pursue their dreams and think outside of the box. “Once you look at how to start something that has to do with what you love, your ideas and your creativeness will compel you to make something and start your own company.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>And although Noel is busy managing his own company, he still finds time to balance his schoolwork. “I have to manage my time which is really important,” he says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Noel’s mother, Countess LuAnn, could not be more happier with her son’s accomplishments. “I’m very proud of Noel,” she tells us. “It’s been something he’s taken great pride in. To actually see it come to life, I think it’s great. He’s a little entrepreneur.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Likewise, the Countess can celebrate the accomplishments of both of her children. “<strong>Victoria</strong> just won an award from the Long House in East Hampton,” she shares. “She did a solar panel home and got first place for her design.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Watch out LuAnn, you’re breeding a whole slew of little entrepreneurs!</p><h3>— Michael Emer, reporting by Lindsey DiMattina</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlhZH13e5FrZpynpaPBpr%2FSZqOumZ6jeqWxjKWcrKuVpcBuus6eo2aekaOwurLOqKNmq5uWwaauzpqpnatf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
