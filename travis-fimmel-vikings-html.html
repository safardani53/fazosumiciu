When Ragnar Lothbrok, portrayed by Travis Fimmel, was killed off in season 4 of Vikings, fans could not help but wonder, “Why did Travis Fimmel leave Vikings?” 
Created by Michael Hirst, Vikings premiered in 2013 on the History Channel.  
The series was initially meant to be a miniseries, but because of the binge-worthy storyline and electric performance by Fimmel as Lothbrok, the show continued for six seasons."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unfortunately, in season 4, Lothbrok’s arc ended, much to the fans’ surprise.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Travis Fimmel as Ragnar Lothbrok in 'Vikings' </strong>(Source: Travis Fimmel/&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Kings Ecbert and Aelle capture Lothbrok, and to punish the Viking for the death of Aelle’s brother, Aethelwulf; he was chucked into a pit of venomous snakes.&nbsp;</p><p>The following seasons focus more on his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean. But the departure of the central character blindsided the audiences who wanted answers to their questions.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Why did Travis Fimmel leave ‘Vikings?’</h2><p>In many other TV series, lead actors often leave because of creative conflicts or personal reasons, but that wasn’t the case for Fimmel.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to the series creator, Lothbrok’s time in the story had ended. Hirst was determined that Lothbrok would die at some point and that his sons would take over because it was poetic and a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">historical necessity</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dark Ages historical records stated that Lothbrok ultimately met his end; therefore, Fimmel’s exit was not scripted but always intended. And therefore, the demise of his character did not come as a shock for Fimmel.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In fact, the actor actually got to remain in the series longer than he was supposed to.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He was initially meant to be killed off in the first season, but his impact on the series was so massive that he became indispensable. He also made it possible for other characters to continue with the series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The actor told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, “I was meant to die at the end of the first year but I ended up staying around for three more.” As a result, the actor was more than grateful and happy to leave the show naturally.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Travis Fimmel after ‘Vikings’</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>After closing the door on an indelible character, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Vikings&nbsp;actor</a>&nbsp;appeared in the action blockbuster&nbsp;Warcraft&nbsp;the same year as his final episode in&nbsp;Vikings.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, he appeared as Ray Thompson in&nbsp;Lean On Pete. The film is about a 15-year-old boy who travels across the US with an aging racehorse in search of a long-lost aunt.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Since then, he has made numerous appearances in films including&nbsp;Finding Steve McQueen, Danger Close: The Battle Of Long Tan, and&nbsp;Dreamland. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for TV roles, the actor promised he would not do another TV series again after the Norse mythological drama. But when he got a call for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lead role</a>&nbsp;in Ridley Scott’s sci-fi drama,&nbsp;Raised By Wolves, he could not turn down the offer.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actor always wanted to work with Scott, and he took the offer without even reading the script.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyilsOqv4yfoKallaF6t7XKoqWgq16dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
