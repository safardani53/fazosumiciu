His shoulder-length, platinum blonde hair was still intact, until the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>makeup guru</a> took a hair clipper and began to shave. The video then cut to Jeffree ripping off his designer robe, and after a smooth transition, Jeffree popped out with this brand-new pink buzzcut and a neon yellow pantsuit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fellow famous MUAs jumped into Jeffree’s comments section to rave over his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hair makeover</a>. “Wow!!!,” <strong>Jaclyn Hill</strong> commented, while <strong>Erika La’ Pearl</strong> wrote, “Omg [blushing emoji] I love it.” Jeffree’s many other fans were in agreement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Jeffree Star with his blonde bob in Jan. 2021.

It didn’t take Jeffree long to clarify that he has “never hung out” with the rapper, and that the rumor was a “lie.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5BtZqOdlpu%2FprGMrKuaql2drqq%2BjKaYpJ2fq7Kzec%2BipaRlkqrHu6%2FUrWSvoZSavG68x6irqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
