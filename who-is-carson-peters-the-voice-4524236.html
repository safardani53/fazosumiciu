He’s from Tennessee.&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Carson tells the coaches he’s from Piney Flats, Tennessee. When he’s not performing, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Carson says</a> he’s just an “ordinary country boy who enjoys baseball, basketball, golf, hunting, riding his four-wheeler and going to church.”</p><h2><strong><strong>3. He can play the fiddle.&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Carson reveals during his blind audition that he started out playing the fiddle, even though he plays the guitar in his debut Voice performance.
