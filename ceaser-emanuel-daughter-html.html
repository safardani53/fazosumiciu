Until April 2022, Ceaser was on the defensive as Cheyenne and her mother, Crystal, were on the offensive. He was only defending himself, denying the accusations against him.
Now, however, he has called his daughter out, saying a few unsavory things about her on Instagram."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This made headlines, and many Instagram pages shared the wholesome moment. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, in one of those Instagram posts, someone saw a chance to take a dig at Ceaser. They said that he should be taking notes from Lil Scrappy on how to treat his daughter and tagged his IG on the comment.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Ceaser noticed the nasty comment and hit back with some strong words. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He responded, saying Emani deserved everything she was getting from her parents and that for his daughter, the same was not the case.</p><p>"My daughter doesn't deserve sh** with her lying a**," he strongly suggested.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Ceaser Emanuel made unsavory comments about his daughter, Cheyenne Emanuel, in April 2022.</strong> (Photo: Hollywood Unlocked/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Further, he also asked the user not to call him out like that again. "please don't at me again or I will get disrespectful. You don't know me," he added.</p><h2>Ceaser Emanuel's Physical Assault Allegations</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The drama began in 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ceaser began his 2021 in the worst way possible. Cheyenne, his then-16 years old kid, accused him of physically abusing her during an Instagram live session in January 2021.</p><p>By her accounts, the assault had happened three months prior at the time, which means the incident occurred around October 2020.</p><p>She claimed that Ceaser dragged her out of the shower while she was naked and punched and stomped her for merely not doing the dishes. Further, he allegedly even broke down two glass doors to get to her while she was showering and threw a speaker at her head.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In the same IG live, she accused Ceaser's girlfriend, Suzette, of doing voodoo on her father.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>A while later, Cheyenne took to Instagram stories to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">address the incident</a> for "the last time."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"The level of disrespect from my pulling me out of the shower then beating me while I was naked is a problem, period!!" she wrote. "I have no reason to fabricate a story. It's a shame that because he's on TV that people would think it is okay to kick me, punch me, and stomp me like I'm a dog in the street."</p><p>Crystal, too, added her side of the story. She said Cheyenne had woken her up at 2 AM that night, crying and telling her father had "beat her." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"This has psychologically damaged my child," she said in her writing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As she was in another state that day, she had "no choice but to alert the authorities" and booked a flight immediately after to get back to her kid.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Soon after this, Ceaser put out a statement denying all accusations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"My daughter Cheyenne and I are not on great terms. However, I would never physically abuse her. I have only done what many parents would have when their child has crossed the line and that is discipline&nbsp;my child," his statement read.</p><p>Further, he also called her the only heir to his Black Ink Tattoo studios and said she was "just&nbsp;having a hard time adjusting to no longer being the only child and having to share her father."</p><p>In May 2021, Crystal revealed Ceaser had sent her a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cease and desist letter</a> to stop her from speaking about the incident. She also alleged he was using Cheyenne for a storyline on the show. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cheyenne later opined that her father would never send a legal order to her and her mother if he never did what she accused him of.</p><p>Crystal, just days later, filed sole legal papers herself. She requested the court stop Ceaser from contacting Cheyenne or coming within ten miles of her.</p><p>Things then went to court.&nbsp;Crystal argued Ceaser's actions had caused her daughter mental and emotional stress and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed a motion</a> of contempt against his legal team. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ceaser, around that time, was hopeful about repairing his relationship with his kid. With the recent comments, though, it seems like all bridges have been burned.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuVlsCmvoyepJqmpZq5brDArp6hrJWne6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
