He’s a great guy. He’s been super supportive of me …&nbsp;you may or may not see him at the [RHOM season 5] reunion, but I don’t wanna dive into that too much. We’ll just see how that unfolds.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The reality star added that Glidden, 49, is “different” than what she’s used to in relationships. “[He]&nbsp;has empathy, he cares. … He wants to motivate me to do better, be my best. So, it’s a lot of things that I’m not used to dealing with, or&nbsp;used to having from my previous relationship,” she explained.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Lisa was previously married to Lenny — with whom she shares son Logan, 7, and daughter Elle, 3 — for nearly 13 years<a href=#> before their abrupt May 2022 split</a>, which occurred while they were filming season 5 of the Bravo series.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">In November 2022, the pair’s <a href=#>divorce turned tumultuous</a> after Lisa claimed in court documents that Lenny had restricted her credit card access.&nbsp;The alleged action resulted in Canada native reportedly being unable to “buy diapers and food” for their kids.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Lenny, for his part, previously claimed that his estranged wife&nbsp;made $30,000 per episode of RHOM. Last month, he alleged in new court documents obtained by Us Weekly<b class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</b>that Lisa has made “excessive temporary support” demands amid their divorce.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">In October 2022, Lisa spoke exclusively with Us&nbsp;<a href=#>about the messy split</a> and shared that she wasn’t looking forward to reliving the events on television.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I’m dreading it ’cause I wasn’t expecting it, <a href=#>and I was a mess</a>. Like, I couldn’t control my emotions,” the TV personality said at the time. “When the viewers tune in, they will see [that] I was just … I wasn’t myself. Nobody recognized me. I didn’t recognize me.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Since meeting Glidden, however, Lisa has seemingly found some peace about the situation, telling ET on Wednesday that she’s “not excited <a href=#>about everything that happened</a>” but there’s “nothing she can do” to change how things unfolded. “Obviously I wish it didn’t go down like that. But it did, and it’s real life,” she said.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">She added, “This <a href=#>was the darkest time of my life</a>. Compare it to a death, or worse; probably worse. A&nbsp;lot of people do say that it’s almost worse than a death, depending on how amicable or not your divorce is, and mine is definitely not&nbsp;amicable at this point.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Now, it’s all about focusing on the future and finding her new normal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“I want to be happy again,” she shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not that I’m so sad. I have, like, bits and pieces of happiness.&nbsp;It goes in waves, but ultimately I want to be&nbsp;in a long-term relationship. I would love to get married again. I just want to be standing on my own two feet and look back at this and not be angry about it.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Scroll down to learn more about Lisa’s new boyfriend:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BhtrSt0mafqJuYqMGmtc2sZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWRuZaSdtq%2Bz0marqGWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXZ%2B8pcWMoKOinJSau3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
