The actress arrived in head-to-toe <strong>Dior</strong>, wearing a black leather bodysuit which featured short sleeves, a wrap front, and a collar, while the bottom half of the one-piece was made up of super short hot pants. On top of the bodysuit, she donned a gorgeous sheer black maxi skirt, while the hem of the flowy skirt was decorated in gorgeous blue and green floral embroidery. Around her waist she donned a black leather <strong>Dior</strong> belt bag, and topped her look off with blue ankle-strap sandals. Meanwhile, <strong>Katie Holmes</strong>, 40, rocked a leather look that same night, when she headed to the 14th Annual <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tribeca Film Festival</a> Artists Dinner hosted by <strong>Chanel</strong>, at Balthazar restaurant in New York City, on April 29. Katie went with a much sexier look than she usually wears when she donned a full <strong>Zeynep Arcay</strong> black leather suit. Katie opted to go completely braless under the double-breasted blazer with gold buttons, and paired the jacket with super skin-tight black leather skinny pants. She accessorized her look with a big coral <strong>Chanel</strong> quilted cross-body bag, adding a bold pop of color, and topped the look off with simple black pointy-toed pumps.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Leather’s not a trend — it’s a lifestyle. And that’s why it was one of the most popular fabrics of choice for outerwear, both on and off the runway, during Paris Fashion Week! <strong>Bella Hadid</strong>, 22, wore a black leather trench coat from <strong>Alyx Studio</strong> on the streets of France’s capital on March 3, proving that the cyberpunk trend has yet to die out. Fellow model <strong>Kaia Gerber</strong>, 17, also took a break from walking down the runway to walk down the streets in a black leather jacket by <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong>, cut as a flared blazer. <strong>Idris Elba</strong>, who was crowned the “Sexiest Man Alive” for People’s&nbsp;Nov. 2018 cover, wore that title well in a <strong>Givenchy</strong> jacket to the&nbsp;Turn Up Charlie&nbsp;premiere in West Hollywood on March 2. Unlike your typical leather jacket, the Givenchy piece was a hybrid of leather and black nylon. Don’t be afraid to mix and match fabrics — or wear it with an extra kick. <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>, 22, did just that by rocking an <strong>Alberta Ferretti</strong> biker jacket, lined with a generous amount of fringe, en route to a therapy session with husband <strong>Justin Bieber</strong> in New York City on Feb. 28 — see the western look below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Of course, leather isn’t strictly reserved for jackets and coats. Like Hailey, <strong>Priyanka Chopra</strong>, 36, also wore <strong>Alberta Ferretti</strong>, but paired the designer pants with a leather crop top. We also saw <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong>, 23, shake up the norm by wearing not a trench leather coat, but a leather trench minidress&nbsp;by <strong>Longchamp</strong> for the brand’s New York Fashion Week show on Feb. 9.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lupita-leather-embed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/katie-leather-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Don’t worry, we haven’t forgotten about pants. <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>, 34, and <strong>Rita Ora</strong>, 28, made great cases as for why you should venture from your everyday denim.
