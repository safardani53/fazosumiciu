The blonde beauty showed off the blast she was having while dancing on the gorgeous island of Skiathos, Greece, in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an Instagram video</a> she posted on June 30. She frolicked and picked up handfuls of water in a black swimsuit as <strong>ABBA</strong>’s 1970s hit “Mamma Mia” played over the clip and appeared to be having the time of her life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><span>“Can’t stop, won’t stop dancing 💃 in Skiathos, Greece 🇬🇷 Mamma Mia, what an island!! 🏝,” she exclaimed in the caption. Her post was met with a lot of enthusiastic responses, including some from celebs. “I needed this today,” <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> wrote while <strong>Sharon Stone</strong> shared, “Hello Gorgeous.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BqZqCnnJm2pnnHmq6nZZuqv7V50a6qrJ2coXqstdKsZLKZk53Bbr%2FTZqurp6Cax268yJyqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
