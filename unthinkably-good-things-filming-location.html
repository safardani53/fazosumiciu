When they visit her in Tuscany, the reunion causes each woman to reexamine the state of her own life and relationships. While they have different personalities and perspectives, they know each other’s truths and help to make life-changing decisions.”</p><p style=text-align:start>Allison, for starters, has been enjoying a fling with Nico, her handsome Italian beau, but isn’t sure if she wants to commit to him since her time in Italy is short and she has a promotion to work toward.

And Reesa is emotionally adrift and hoping to find clarity around her marriage to husband Andre.</p><p style=text-align:start>“Between the good wine, delicious food, a healthy serving of romance and the beautiful scenery of Tuscany, the three women relish in the importance of friendship and inspire each other to make this next season the best one yet,” the synopsis adds.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘The Morning Show’ star Karen Pittman leads the cast.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Karen Pittman, who stars as Mia Jordan from <a href=#>The Morning Show</a> and has also recurred on Yellowstone and <a href=#>And Just Like That…</a> recently, plays Allison in Unthinkably Good Things. “[The film is] very much about falling in love with your life, not just falling in love with your romantic partner,” Karen told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> recently.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Joyful Drake of Let’s Stay Together and Hush fame plays Melina in the movie, and Erica Ash of MADtv and Survivor’s Remorse plays Reesa.</p><p style=text-align:start>The menfolk of the movie, meanwhile, includes Luca Seta (Love & Gelato) as Nico, Jermaine Love (Rogue Warfare) as Lucas, and Lance Gross (<a href=#>House of Payne</a>) as Andre.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The movie filmed on location in Italy.</h2><p style=text-align:start>Like us, you might be accustomed to cable TV movies trying to pass off Canadian filming locations as settings around the world.
