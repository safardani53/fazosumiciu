During the Wednesday, September 20, episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Earle, 22, about social media users calling her a “mistress” and a “homewrecker” after Culpo, 26, accused Berrios, 27, of infidelity in June.
“When I was reading these comments, I was bawling my eyes out to my friends and they were like, ‘Hello, Alix, this stuff normally does not get to you,'” the influencer explained."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She noted that “everyone kind of just pointed fingers at me” when Culpo “started posting things alluding to unfaithfulness in the relationship.”</p><p>Back in June, Berrios took to social media to <a href=#>shut down speculation</a> that he’d been unfaithful to Culpo, whom he began dating in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earle-Addresses-Claims-She-Was-a-Homewrecker-in-Sophia-Culpo-and-Braxton-Berrios-Relationship-3.jpg><p>“I don’t want to start anything, I don’t want to fuel anything. I genuinely want all this to be over and everyone to move on and do whatever makes them happy,” he said via his Instagram Story at the time. “I was in a relationship for two years. It was a good relationship, it was a healthy one and towards the end of it we had conversations along the lines of ‘we weren’t working out.’ So, <a href=#>when we split</a> back in January, that’s why.”</p><p>Berrios added that the breakup “had nothing to do with anybody else.” In response, Culpo shared her side of the story one day later in a since-deleted TikTok.</p><p>“The real timeline. We broke up after the <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> concert Super Bowl weekend [in February] where he was seen making out with another girl,” she claimed in the video. “Not bitter, in fact I know this situation has been one of my biggest blessings. I wish everyone in this situation all the best, including myself which is why I’m here to <a href=#>share the truth</a> so I can officially be done with all of this. All love ❤️.”</p><p>Despite Culpo’s claims, Earle told Cooper, 29, on Wednesday that she asked Berrios “for the receipts right away” to make sure she hadn’t inadvertently been part of infidelity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Alix-Earle-Addresses-Claims-She-Was-a-Homewrecker-in-Sophia-Culpo-and-Braxton-Berrios-Relationship-2.jpg><p>“I was like there’s just no f—king way this happened. I was checking everything,” she said. “We have probably been over this a hundred and ten times because I was like, if you did that to a person, obviously of course, you’ll probably do that to me too and if I did that to someone else, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for where Earle and Berrios stand now, Earle confirmed she is currently single and that she and Berrios <a href=#>were never exclusive</a>.</p><p>“We started talking at a very weird time in my life, I was finishing college,” she explained. “As much as we were hanging out, it never felt like the right time to start a relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJmteqat0aWcZpyVo7amv4ybqZqwpKS7bq7Eq6mip6NisKmxwK2cnWWfo3q0u8%2BhoJplk6q5sbuMsKCtoF2dsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
