I like.”</p><h3><strong>Primark, gold, £12&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>She was even more impressed when she tried on a gold swimsuit, also from Primark, as she revealed: “This one is my favourite one so far, I’m obsessed, this is a vibe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/excl-im-size-18-fashionista-812793014.jpg><p>“You’ve got ruching on the sides here which is adjustable, and it’s got that really <span id=676f8a78-32a9-4ab9-91b7-686573e7f6ea class=suggested-link>nice</span> high leg, which I love.</p><p>“I feel like this is really good for girls who aren’t too confident with their stomachs, because of the ruching.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel like it’s really flattering and it holds you in.</p><p>“It’s got that low back so you can still get good tan lines and the top is an adjustable halterneck.</p><p>“For me, 10 out of 10.
