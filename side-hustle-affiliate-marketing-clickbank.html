TikToker Dankorsby describes himself as an “online profits coach” to his 55,000 followers on the platform.
While the influencer often makes content about different side hustle options to his viewers, he was eager to share one in particular recently.
“This is the best side hustle to start before 2023,” Dankorsby said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

hustle</a> options to his viewers, he was eager to share one in particular recently.</p><p>“This is the best side hustle to start before 2023,” Dankorsby said.</p><p>The gig, affiliate marketing, is ideal if you have no money to start with and also don’t want to show your face to the public, he added.</p><p>The TikToker was able to make a whopping $22,781.90 from the gig in the last month alone.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about side hustles">Read more about side hustles</h2><p>So how exactly did he go about getting this money?</p><p>Dankorsby said his first step was to go to the website ClickBank.com.</p><p>ClickBank is a worldwide e-commerce platform and affiliate marketplace that boasts more than six million clients and over 1.5million affiliate marketers.</p><p>Creating a profile on ClickBank is entirely free, and once you’re inside, you go to the Affiliate Marketplace.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>In the Affiliate Marketplace, there’s a wide range of product and service options, spanning all the way from games, family, and sports to travel.</p><p>In Dankorsby’s case, he chose the self-help option.</p><p>But you shouldn’t choose just any product from the Affiliate Marketplace lineup.</p><p>Dankorsby said his secret is to sort through the products by “gravity.”</p><p>Sorting by the highest gravity means you will see the top selling products on the ClickBank database.</p><p>“You want to find one with a high gravity score and a good average dollar per conversion,” Dankorsby said.</p><p>Once you find the right product, the rest is simple.</p><p>Just copy your affiliate link to share with your own audience and start making a profit, the influencer instructed.</p><h2>What exactly does gravity mean?</h2><p>When selecting the best product to promote on ClickBank, you need to understand the importance of a gravity score.</p><p>The larger the gravity score, the more popular a product is.</p><p>It’s calculated through the number of sales affiliates make, meaning that every one sale will equal one gravity point.</p><p>If you see thousands and thousands of successful sales, you might be in luck and this product is for you.</p><h2>Tips for success</h2><p>When selecting your first product to promote, you also need to think about your own niche as a social media presence or content creator.</p><p>You want to choose something that adequately reflects who you are and is the type of product that others would be interested in knowing your opinion on.</p><p>So if you’re big into weightlifting, and your audience knows that, choosing a fitness product to promote would be the perfect way to recommend an item to others while making a hefty amount of spare change.</p><p>At the same time, make sure to always choose types of products that won’t lose their appeal.</p><p>Some product types, like weight loss, fertility, or relationships, will likely always have a steady stream of hungry buyers, so these are the best ones to sort through when deciding which specific item you want to promote.</p><p>While building out traffic to your affiliate link through social media will be necessary, it also pays to create an email list.</p><p>This way, you have a constant connection with the types of consumers that might be looking to buy this product.</p><p>Engagement with your email list, and the people that follow you generally, will get you further than just sending out basic mass emails as well.</p><p>People want to feel that this is the product specifically for them, and that you gave them a special recommendation for it, so work on building those relationships.</p><p>Just remember, all side income you earn needs to be reported to the IRS.</p><p>Otherwise, you risk facing hefty fines.</p><h2>Other side hustles available</h2><p>Americans all across the country are looking for side hustles to beef up their wallets as they face record high levels of <a href=#>inflation.</a></p><p>Luckily, there are plenty more options even if you don’t choose to promote a product with your own social media accounts.</p><p>Some successful side hustles only require you to keep track of your previous study notes.</p><p>In fact, one TikToker has been able to net <a href=#>$5,000 a month</a> just selling her old class notes to a study website.</p><p>If you find yourself regularly finding items or furniture on streets left out as trash, you can turn this trash into gold by selling the items on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>One woman has taken up this gig and has now <a href=#>made $37,000.</a></p><p>There are seasonal side hustles too, including this easy <a href=#>YouTube video creation</a> that could bring in $36,000 this holiday season.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The
