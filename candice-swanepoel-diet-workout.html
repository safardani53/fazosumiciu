Her personality, along with her physical charisma, has people swooning over her.</p><p>However, Swanepoel was not born with a body that looks like it was crafted carefully by sculptures. She has a workout and diet routine that has helped her maintain her body measurements.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Here is all we know about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Candice Swanepoel’s body measurements</h2><p>Swanepoel is an incredible model who has risen to recognition due to her towering stature. It is reported that her height in feet is 5 feet 9 inches tall, and her height in centimeters is 177 cm (1.77 m).</p><p>Similarly, the model weight is 54 kgs or 119 pounds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Candice Swanepoel’s diet</h2><p>Swanepoel’s diet differs from those that believe in the traditional view of dieting. She loves eating her breakfast entirely since it prevents her from munching later in the day.&nbsp;</p><p>This also increases her metabolism and aids her in maintaining her ideal dimensions. Her breakfast usually starts with some protein, such as bacon and eggs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Swanepoel told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Cut</a> in 2017 that her mood determines her breakfast preference and that she prefers healthy smoothies for a non-caffeinated morning boost, with her favorite healthy drink containing coconut oil, flaxseed oil, banana, protein, some kind of antioxidant fruit like blueberries or strawberries, or some nut butter.</p><p>Swanepoel likes coffee but often avoids caffeine in the morning. As a result, her go-to beverage would be a smoothie or a cup of decaf to help restore her energy levels.</p><p>The model opts for a full lunch of grilled chicken and brown rice with vegetables. This is her go-to meal, especially when pressed for work time.</p><p>She prefers a light meal, generally consisting of a fresh salad or a light soup. She eats in this order to maintain her perfect metabolism but also listens to her body.&nbsp;</p><p>She isn’t concerned about what she eats and doesn’t believe in calorie counting. It’s largely because she was born with rapid metabolism and can eat nearly anything without gaining weight.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Candice-Swanepoel.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">The secret to Candice Swanepoel’s body is balanced diet and workout routines. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>While Swanepoel maintains a well-balanced diet and dislikes restricting herself when eating foods she enjoys, her diet varies before and during Victoria’s Secret fashion shows.</p><p>During these periods, she makes certain that she only consumes fresh meals and that her nutritional needs are addressed adequately. She also begins drinking caffeinated coffee during her shows since managing two children and preparing for the act may be demanding.</p><p>Regardless, the secret behind Swanepoel’s stunning physique is her well-maintained balanced diet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Candice Swanepoel’s workout</h2><p>Alongside a balanced diet, Swanepoel’s workout routine helps her maintain her body measurements, height, and weight.&nbsp;</p><p>Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">workout</a> exercises include jogging, resistance training, boxing, weightlifting, circuit training, yoga, Pilates, spinning, and Bosu balls. Similarly, her routines incorporate both aerobic and weight training.&nbsp;</p><p>The early cardio helps her burn calories and keep her heart healthy, while the resistance workouts tone her body, and yoga helps her de-stress. She also enjoys aerobic activities, particularly running.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She prefers to run in natural areas rather than on a treadmill in her gym. Similarly, her other cardio activities include swimming, hiking, and walking.</p><p>Like many models, Swanepoel enjoys boxing and utilizes it to tone her physique and increase strength without fattening up. It also serves as a great core workout and helps her with her other routines.&nbsp;</p><p>Swanepoel’s trainer Justin Gelband told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pop Workouts</a> that continually altering routines is essential for her Angel-ready fitness program. He said, “Most of the [Victoria’s Secret] girls are concerned about their butt, hips, and thighs. I devise a circuit class based on all the different body parts.”</p><p>This includes boxing which is one of Gelband’s favorite Angel-ready workouts. Boxing helps practically every aspect of the body and is an excellent method to strengthen the core.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Gelband works out with Swanepoel every day in the days leading up to a show, with boxing being one of their most-practiced routines. Along with boxing, Swanepoel tones and strengthens her physique with a full-body circuit program.&nbsp;</p><p>Her circuits incorporate extra weight using ankle weights, gliding discs, resistance bands, and bodyweight vests. The model also does yoga and pilates.&nbsp;</p><p>She admitted that she gets a quick dose of mental serenity from yoga when anxious or too fatigued to undertake her normal routines. She also does this to keep her body flexible and herself at peace.&nbsp;</p><p>She does yoga at least twice a week and substitutes for Pilates on the other days. So, with the help of these workout routines and diets, Swanepoel has managed to maintain her body for over a decade.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8KapZ2hk5p6tMPAp5ypp5WheqW1xK1ksKeioLy2wI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
