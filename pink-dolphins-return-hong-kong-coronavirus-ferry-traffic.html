For years, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, also known as Chinese white dolphins and pink dolphins, had been avoiding the Pearl River Delta due to the area's high-speed ferries traveling between Hong Kong and Macau. But after ferry activity was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the dolphins almost immediately began returning to the waters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"I’ve been studying these dolphins since 1993 and I’ve never seen anything like this dramatic change before, and the only thing that changed is 200 ferries stopped traveling before."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to local Hong Kong residents sending Porter a yacht and boat, she and her team were able to drop microphones into the water and use drones to study the dolphins.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"From visual observations, the dolphins are spending much more time socializing, splashing around on the surface, quite a bit of foreplay, quite a bit of sex," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">WWF Hong Kong, a conservation group partnered with Porter's study, said on its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>website</a> that there are likely around 2,500 dolphins in the Pearl River Delta.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the group noted there has been a "worrisome decrease in the number of young dolphins" in Hong Kong's waters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I sometimes feel that we’re studying the slow demise of this population, which can be really sad," Porter told Reuters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to WWF Hong Hong, the major threats to the dolphins include overfishing, water pollution, heavy marine traffic, and coastal development.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is necessary to take a proactive approach in order to conserve the remaining population of the species before it’s too late," the conservation group said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CawbR7z6KlpGWUpLmxtMinqmaqlanCs7qMoaann12gvK%2BzjJymq6eelsOqvtSsZJ%2BdoqfGbsDRmp2foZNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
