The chances of that are basically zero.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the odds were in her favor: Caliendo carried her baby to term and her surrogate gave birth to twins just five months later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When it rains, it pours,” she says, joking about welcoming daughter Harlow in August 2017 and twins Piper and Presley in January 2018. “We couldn’t even believe it.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Pete Pasetsky and Tracy Caliendo with their children.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Oku Okoko</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With three babies — whom the New York mom describes as “essentially triplets” — Caliendo and Pasetsky, a 42-year-old equity trader, were “beyond thrilled and over the moon.” At last, the couple had the big family they always dreamed of — and, much to their surprise, it was about to get even bigger.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after welcoming Piper and Presley, the parents of four found out they were expecting again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Out of nowhere, I ended up pregnant naturally, without even trying,” says Caliendo, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>documents her journey on Instagram</a>. “It was a bit frightening.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite smooth pregnancies with Hunter and Harlow, her third was high-risk for both the mother and baby. Caliendo developed a serious condition called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>placenta accreta</a>, which happens when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We found experts in the field. We had doctors who were wonderful, and I was very heavily watched,” says Caliendo. “I had to be seen by a doctor every two weeks from the day I found out I was pregnant and then once every week as I got closer to my due date. I wasn’t even allowed to leave New York City.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Sept. 21, 2018, Caliendo gave birth to Dylan at 29 weeks gestation. Though he has growth and fine motor skills hurdles to overcome, she says her kids are happy and healthy, and that she and her husband could not be more thankful for their unusual circumstances.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While raising their children — Hunter, 12, Harlow, 2, twins Piper and Presley, 20 months, and Dylan, 11 months — both parents are also now back to work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When you have to feed five kids, you know you’re going to be working the rest of your life,” Caliendo says, adding that she and her husband run a tight ship and have a full-time babysitter in order to stay sane.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wake-up time is 6 a.m., followed by playtime at 7, milk at 9, lunch at noon, naptime at 1 and dinner at 5.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We literally live by a clock,” says Caliendo. “But no matter how difficult the day gets, we always remember what it took to get here.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When you struggle, you do get a totally different perspective,” she adds. “When people say to me, ‘Oh my God, my kids are driving me crazy, I need a break,’ all I think to myself is, ‘You have these healthy children. You’re so lucky.’ “</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8yapaGZpKmur3nMqKRmq6Wnv7CzwK2cZmxdmLWquMOrnKdlmaN6cn%2BMpqanrJiofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
