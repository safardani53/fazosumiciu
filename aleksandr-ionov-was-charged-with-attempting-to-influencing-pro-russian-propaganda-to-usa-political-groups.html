He has been accused of starting a Change.org petition in which the United States is accused of genocide against Africans. It has been suspected that Ionov may have also funded the Uhuru movement, which aims to promote civil rights and development on the African continent. According to NBC, the FBI searched the movement’s headquarters after Ionov’s indictment.</p><p>Aside from claims of slandering the American government, Ionov was also charged with meddling with municipal elections in St. Petersburg, Florida, with prosecutors alleging that he acted as the Kremlin’s liaison in supporting certain political campaigns. The papers did not name the US lawmakers who were participating in the scheme. According to authorities, Ionov and the FSB oversaw certain candidates and helped organize their campaigns for a 2019 Florida election. Ionov, on the other hand, has denied the claims. Aleksandr issued an official statement after the announcement of the indictment.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aleksandr-Ionov-3.jpg alt="Aleksandr Ionov" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He stated:</p><p>“We got distressing news today regarding my placement on the sanctions list and the opening of criminal prosecution against me.
