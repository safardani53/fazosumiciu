It is a heart-stopping narrative of terror and survival punctuated by unimaginable acts of bravery, as an active shooter turns a night of celebration into the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Country Superstar Jason Aldean has never spoken in depth about that night – until now, on the 5th anniversary of the incident.<p>The power of 11 MINUTES is in its immediacy. Many of the first-person stories told by concert goers, Las Vegas Metropolitan PD, Sunrise Hospital trauma staff and FBI Agents are visually documented in real time by bodycam footage and 200 hours of cell phone video. In one instance, viewers accompany heavily armed officers on their step-by-step assault of the shooter’s hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay. 58 lives would be lost and over 800 people injured.</p><p>Among the handful of courageous people 11 MINUTES follows are: a Black man who feels unwelcome at first, but becomes a hero when the shooting starts; an off duty firefighter who is a lifesaver in a crowd of injured; a cancer survivor who beat the odds once already and won’t quit now; a cop who drags his wounded partner to safety. The performers themselves have narrow escapes. Dee Jay Silver tells the harrowing story of the moment he realized his one year-old son was with a babysitter in a hotel room a few doors down from where the shooter was firing. Storme Warren, the popular Sirius XM radio host and festival emcee, can’t forget watching concert goers fall one by one under the hail of bullets. And every parent can feel the anger of Ann-Marie and Jim Parsons who lost their 31-year old daughter Carrie in a spasm of violence that even the FBI can’t explain. But the Parsons have channeled their pain into activism seeking to spare other families from their grief.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JoaGplnZ67tsDErGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
