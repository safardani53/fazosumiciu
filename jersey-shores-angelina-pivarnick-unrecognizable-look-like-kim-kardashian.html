Fans slammed the 35-year-old earlier this month for &#34;photoshopping herself&#34; so much that she looked like one of the Kardashian sisters.
Angelina shared videos to her Instagram Stories of her in full glam after a session with her hair and makeup team.

I also never ever got a nose job. Same nose since I was born. So nice try on that. I just contour it now with makeup!"</p><p>"MY ONLY SURGERY HAS BEEN MY BOOBS! Ask my plastic surgeon. He knows. I’ve gotten injections and that’s it!"</p><p>However, Angelina later decided to get a butt lift and lipo as well, as she live-streamed the process.</p><p>Back in July, the star also shared she underwent a&nbsp;<a href=#>fat-burning procedure</a>&nbsp;on her stomach saying it was "worth the hype" and she's had "amazing results."</p><p>Angelina wrote over another snap: "So far amazing results. Today is session #4, and my tummy is flatter!!! I even see crazy definition.
