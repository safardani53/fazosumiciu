“I think the first time I saw her is when I met her at Canter’s, the deli in Los Angeles,” Brody, 43, recalled during the Wednesday, April 12, episode of Stitcher Studios’ “Popcrushed” podcast.

And I was, you know, smitten for a long time,” the California native explained. “<a href=#>I didn’t get to know her for many years after</a>, even though we even worked together briefly.”</p><p>Brody and Meester costarred in 2011’s The Oranges, but they didn’t spark romance speculation until two years later. Us Weekly <a href=#>broke the news in February 2013</a> that the duo were “hanging out” and dating.</p><p>“She’s so lovely, and she’s so sweet,” the <a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a> alum told Meester’s former <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Penn Badgley</strong></a> and his <a href=#>podcast cohosts, <strong>Sophie Ansari</strong> and <strong>Nava Kavelin</strong></a>, on Wednesday. “She’s so nice. She’s so good.”</p><p>The Shazam! Fury of the Gods actor, however, recalled the Country Strong star <a href=#>being a little reluctant to start a relationship with him</a>.</p><p>“She remained elusive to me for so long, you know, and aloof,” Brody said. “I couldn’t get a total read because even though she professe[d] to have been interested in me and all those things — not only did she not pursue that, I mean, <a href=#>she was perfectly willing to let that never happen</a>.”</p><p>He joked: “She was perfectly willing to let that message in the bottle return to sea at several points.”</p><p>Badgley, 36, weighed in on Meester’s laid-back style, saying with a laugh, “That means she already had faith in your love. She was already letting you go.”</p><p>Brody seemingly agreed, telling listeners, “[Leighton] says, ‘Oh, it’s because I knew if we did [date] it would be a thing.’ Or, like, ‘It’s too powerful.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>a slow start to their relationship</a>, Us confirmed in February 2014 that the StartUp alum and the Texas native <a href=#>said “I do” in an intimate ceremony</a> in California.</p><p>Us exclusively confirmed in September 2015 that <a href=#>the twosome welcomed their first child</a>, daughter Arlo. Brody and Meester <a href=#>expanded their family in September 2020</a> when the Ready or Not actor announced the birth of their son.
