After being bullied and called fat throughout her pregnancy with daughter <strong>North</strong>, the newly svelte reality star is proudly flaunting her famous curves all over town. On Wednesday, Oct. 30, she filmed an appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, where she showed off her post-baby <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> in a see-through white-lace dress over a black bra and matching hot pants.</p><p>Speaking with Leno about the fat-shaming she endured while pregnant, the 33-year-old bombshell said she took the criticism to heart. “It really hurt my soul,” she confessed. “It changed how I am in public. I’ve tried to live more of a private life.”</p><p>Indeed, Kardashian and fiance <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> kept a low profile after the June birth of their baby daughter. But now that the new mom has shed 50 pounds — <a href=# rel=noopener>via the Atkins diet</a> — she’s feeling more confident. Exhibit A? Earlier this month, she shared <a href=# rel=noopener>a super-revealing photo of herself</a> in a skimpy white bathing suit, a picture she describes as her “big middle finger to the world.”</p><p>There will always be haters, of course, but Kardashian is loving life at the moment — and with good reason. Last week, on her 33rd birthday, her rapper boyfriend surprised her with an <a href=# rel=noopener>elaborate marriage proposal</a> and a huge cushion-cut diamond ring. “I’m very happy right now,” she told Leno. “[The proposal] was the most magical night of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/186374039_Kim-Kardashian-467.jpg><p>And as for the wedding? “I want [Kanye] to have whatever he wants,” she told Leno of her fiance, noting that “someplace Parisian” might be nice for the France-loving pair. The couple are “hoping for next summer,” she added, but they “haven’t had time to sit down and talk about it.”</p><p>One thing they have talked about is whether the reality star will change her famous name. As West revealed earlier this week, the bride-to-be plans to take her husband’s last name — though she’ll keep Kardashian as her middle name.</p><p>“It’ll definitely be West,” she said of the name change. “My daughter’s name is West, and we’re a family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Speaking of little North, nicknamed “Nori,” the reality star couldn’t help but gush. “She’s the sweetest little girl. She never cries,” the proud mom bragged of her 4-month-old daughter. “She’s a perfect little angel. I hope she grows up to be smart and opinionated like her dad.”</p><p>For much more from Kim Kardashian, tune in to The Tonight Show With Jay Leno at 11:30 p.m. on Oct. 30 on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYsCpu9asZKielmKCcXnPqKynnF2ssqqzx61kpaejqHqquoysnJ5lpJ2%2FsMHGoWSwoJmpsm6w0Z6qrGWjlsa0ec2oqa2gXZ7Abq2MqZyrnpWYwW64yK2rpZ1dlruosctmaWlpY2h9cnyO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
