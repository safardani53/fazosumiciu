In the case of "Fold" on TikTok, it means something a bit similar... but with a twist. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wiki</a>, "Fold" is when a creator feels annoyed, disrespected, or surprised by a comment or situation. As a result, they react by "folding" over their bodies.</p><p>The outlet shares that TikTok creators “suddenly collapse while folding their bodies in half on a chair.” The creator then proceeds to “swing their arms over their heads while bending at the waist with their knees locked in place.” In other words, the Fold Challenge complements folks with a flair for the dramatic.</p><p>The best way to think of it is as the instant reaction to someone or something that makes a creator feel uncomfortable. It adds humor to a situation that may make a person feel awkward or weird.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Fold Challenge on TikTok has garnered a ton of views.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StayHipp,</a> the trend started to gain notoriety in July 2021.
