She’s Been Bleaching Her Top Lip Since She Was 9</b></p><p>“In the Instagram era it’s so easy to edit your life so that it looks perfect,” the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> actress said. “But I bleach my top lip and tweeze my eyebrows and you’d never get to see that, even though it’s a part of my routine. There’s still so much shame around the things you do to get ready while you’ve got a towel wrapped around your head. It’s important to me not to edit that out. I’ve been bleaching my top lip since I was nine. I don’t do it very often, but I do it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/emma-watson-823e87bc-2448-4d69-9614-ac287b7682c4.jpg><p><b>2.) She Grooms Her Privates With Oil</b></p><p>“I use <a href=# rel=noopener>Fur Oil</a>,” she admitted:&nbsp;“I’ll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair. It’s an amazing all-purpose product.”</p><p><b>3.) She Had Terrible Skin</b></p><p>“No matter what, I always wash my face at night,” Watson insisted. “I could get back from a shoot at 4 a.m. and still <a href=# data-link=1>cleanse</a>, tone, and moisturize before going to bed. People are amazed by this, but it’s just one of those self-care practices that I really enjoy. I think it’s because, when I was going through puberty — particularly around ages 14 and 15 — I had really bad skin. So when you get in a good place with you skin, you really appreciate it and try to take care of it.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><b>4.) She’ll Take a Bath Numerous Times a Day</b></p><p>“I have a bath every single day of my life. And if I can have two or three — amazing. Nothing terrible is going to happen in the bath, so I always find time for that. I’ll take phone conversations in the bath, anything. Sometimes I’ll use Epsom salts and oils, but my favorite is the <a href=# rel=noopener>C.O Bigelow Apothecary Cold and Flu Soak</a>. Oh my God, it’s amazing!”</p><p><b>5.) Pedicures, Yes! Manicures, No</b></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Weirdly, I often don’t wear nail polish on my hands in my day-to-day life. It doesn’t seem like a useful way to spend my time when it will be destroyed within minutes. But I love, love, love having my toenails crazy colors. I use the brand <a href=# rel=noopener>Kure Bazaar</a>, which is one of the first brands that excludes things like toluene, formaldehyde, synthetic camphor, but it does actually provide trend colors so it’s pretty cool.”</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5q6rq2MsJitq5%2Bjeq6typ6qZpuRo7GqsIyprJuhk2K1orXRZp6rp5%2Bitq%2BzjJymp56VqMCqu81mrm1vYGyBcXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
