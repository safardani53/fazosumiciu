That is who my priority is,” he screams at Diana in the finale. “I refuse to be blamed any longer for this grotesque misalliance. I wash my hands of it. If you have a complaint about not being loved or appreciated in this marriage, I suggest you take it up with <a href=#>the people who arranged it</a>.”</p><p>The Crown writer and executive producer <strong>Peter Morgan</strong> previewed the fourth season ahead of its debut, <a href=#>opening up about the challenges</a>.</p><p>“It’s very hard to write the innocent start to a relationship when you know how tragically it ended and indeed how unhappy they were throughout it,” he told <a href=#>TVLine</a>.</p><p>Charles and Diana married in July 1981 and had two children, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>. In 1992, the duo separated and four years later, they announced their divorce after both admitted to extramarital affairs.
