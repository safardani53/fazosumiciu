He amassed the lowest combined five-day total of any player in history, leaving fans and even himself slightly astonished. Ben is a content marketing specialist from Dexter, Michigan, who has become the latest Jeopardy! contestant to go on a run, nonetheless.
He beat ​​Andrea Rednick Granados, a community organizer and stay-at-home daughter from Dallas, Texas, and Dan Meuse, a university lecturer from Rhode Island."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

FANS REACT TO BEN'S RECORD</h2><p>Fans reacted to the wild milestone on various internet forums, and didn't know what to make of it since multi-day winners usually rake in bigger bucks.</p><p>One person wrote on Reddit: “HOLY CRAP, lowest 5-day total in the show's history. What are the odds?!"</p><p>Another wrote: “I can't imagine there have been many other 5-day champs who were 1/5 on Final Jeopardy."</p><p>A third joked: “Megan Wachspress 2.0. But hey, a five-game win is a five-game win!</p><p>“All I have to say is, 'Oh my Megan Wachspress' wrote a fourth under a YouTube clip.</p><p>A fifth wrote: "His early wins weren't the prettiest, but some of the clues haven't been the greatest in quality, either, and he has outplayed and/or outwagered the competition."</p><p>"Whether he gets immediately knocked out of the Tournament of Champions or not...there will be <a href=#>two Bens there.</a>"&nbsp;</p><p>A sixth simply wondered: "How are two Americans so good to be on Jeopardy! not knowing about the 'Monroe Doctrine?'"</p><h2>'THIS LOWEST SCORING CHAMP STUFF'</h2><p>Ben wrote to Twitter: "The funny thing about this 'lowest-scoring multi-day champ in Jeopardy! history' stuff is that it was never my intention to be a small-ball, risk-averse player.</p><p>"I wanted to be like <a href=#>Amy Schneider:</a> Aggressive at first, then switching to defense mode after getting a big lead.”</p><p>"But then I went 0-for-4 on wager questions in my first two games, and needed to figure out another path.</p><p>"If the Daily Double/Final Jeopardy questions were going to be landmines for me, I needed to treat them that way.</p><p>"Hence, smaller wagers. Wagering as if I'd get the Final Qs wrong, not right.</p><p>"Mental resiliency is such a big part of this game. That means shaking off setbacks in real-time, and sometimes it means shifting your strategy when you're getting your a** kicked out there."</p><p>He also wrote: "Quick message to the haters: I’d rather win ugly than lose pretty."</p><p>Fans applauded Ben for his honesty as one person replied: "That's smart," and another: "Well, you’re in the ToC, an elite group. Best wishes."</p><h2>'NOT THE SHARPEST WRITING'</h2><p>Ben, who has shared on stage that he fended off a street attack against his boss and was previously a movie reporter, has admittedly faced some inscrutable questions and categories this week.</p><p>On Tuesday's episode,&nbsp;<a href=#>he was tasked with a Daily Double that fans deemed "terrible."</a></p><p>Ben then chimed in on Twitter, and even he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>: "I didn't particularly care for it!"</p><p>Meanwhile, on Monday's episode,&nbsp;Mayim&nbsp;presented a movie mashups category that fans said:&nbsp;<a href=#>"barely even made sense."</a></p><p>The episode ended up having 19 triple stumpers, only a few games after an episode had <a href=#>23 triple stumpers of 60 clues</a> leading execs to say, "<a href=#>Let's forget it ever happened."</a></p><p>On Thursday, even <a href=#>James Holzhauer,</a> 38, told TV Insider: "I think it’s still a great show, but it could use a little tweaking here and there.</p><p>"Some of the question writing could be a little sharper than it has been."</p><p>One Reddit user surmised earlier this week: "Something is definitely off… The number of missed and incorrect clues is an issue. It sucks for contestants, and it sucks for us watching at home.</p><p>The questions seemed atypically difficult, and many were worded poorly."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Another wrote: “The quality of the categories and clues has gone downhill since Alex. I think that's a testament to him going over the clues as part of the writing process."</p><p>Others wondered if the <a href=#>WGA strike</a> has affected the writing quality, while a third argued: "I think that’s what you’re seeing here: the normal summertime crappy clues phenomenon."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/champ-ben-goldstein-sets-baffling-826928840.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/champ-ben-goldstein-sets-baffling-826928839.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/fans-baffled-stupid-daily-double-826665329-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZGiDeYOYaKGep6CWv6XFjJucp2WXpLmlv9OeoKdlp567r7HRZqmem5%2BnsW7AzqegoKCkZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
