While production does work with the miners to map out their season, it rarely goes to plan. "We are there the whole time; we are filming everything we can. But we don’t just turn the cameras on and shoot randomly. We do focus on a story or character; we do try to have a plan each day or at least each week on what we want to emphasize," producer Ed Gorsuch explained. "There’s no scripts written; the edit doesn’t feed them what to do. It comes the other way around; the miners do what they’re going to do, and we give shape to it. And that is the ideal thing."</p><h2>Who narrates Gold Rush?</h2><p>Since Season 1, the series has been <a href=#>narrated by Paul Christie.</a> The voice actor has also been featured on Saturday Night Live, Super Bowl commercials, and Nickelodeon, just in case his voice sounded familiar.</p><h2>Do Gold Rush stars get paid?</h2><p>Yes. While the crews' exact salaries from Discovery are unknown, one Redditor revealed that <a href=#>Parker pays his workers</a> "hourly and his main team a yearly salary (x date to x date) plus bonus."</p><p>Another gold miner unrelated to the show confirmed that the crew is likely paid by commission as well. And Parker has been doing pretty well for himself. The reality star is worth an estimated $8 million — and has mined over $13 million in gold since taking over the Big Nugget from his grandfather.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKxfnLytsIyrrKyg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
